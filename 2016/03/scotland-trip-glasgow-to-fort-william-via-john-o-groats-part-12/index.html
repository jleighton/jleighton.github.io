<p>We arrived at Glasgow on Saturday morning, the flight was fine (the breakfast not...) and headed into Glasgow city to get our train onwards. We travelled on a rover ticket which was pretty cool in itself, £118 for 8 days of travel within 15 days which I'll talk about in the next blog post.</p>

<p><strong>Glasgow Queen Street to Aberdeen: 155 miles (Running total 155 miles)</strong></p>
<p>Aberdeen was our first destination, Brewdog Brewery our goal. The train to Aberdeen was uneventful, we found our hotel and went to find the bus to Ellon.</p>
<p>The bus that greeted us was fairly fancy; a coach with USB ports and reclining seats! It was a comfy ride to Ellon.</p>
<p>Brewdog was a short walk away from the bus stop but it was pissing it down so felt like an age. But once we got there... It was awesome.</p>

<p>The next day we headed to Inverness. It snowed a bit, but nothing major. In fact, it was the most snow we saw all week.</p>
<p>Before we left for Inverness we had something to do... Find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_Lifeboat_Station">RNLI Lifeboat</a> which Laurence actually started the wiki page for...</p>
<p>I didn't actually get a photo of the boat, but I did take this cool timelapse. Laurence probably has some video from his GoPro he hasn't bothered to watch since.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Aberdeen to Inverness: 108 miles (Running total: 263 miles)</strong></p>
<p>We didn't do much in Inverness; looked for cheap GoPro accessories for Laurence and found somewhere to drink. We didn't find any accessories that weren't fifty quid, but we did find a Wetherspoons so not all bad.</p>
<p><strong>Inverness to Wick: 161 miles (Running Total: 424 miles)</strong></p>
<p>Onwards to the far north of Scotland. We got a 7am train to Wick/Thurso the next day. It was fairly desolate and remote, but Wick bigger than we were both expecting. I think we've now frequented the most northerly branch of Wetherspoons in the UK.</p>
<p>We got the bus to John o Groats and think we were pretty much the only tourists around this early in March. Everyone else on the bus had their shopping..</p>
<p>Fun fact.. John o Groats is not the most northerly point of the mainland UK. That is nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunnet_Head">Dunnet Head.</a></p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/11/09.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-580" width="1500" height="2000" alt="09" /></p>
<p>Anyway, we've done John o Groats! Ten minutes of taking photos of the sign, and an 1 hour 50 minutes waiting for the next bus.. Hmm. Anyway, we got to Thurso late afternoon and checked in to our hotel for the night.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do in Thurso. We had a pint in the hotel bar and went for a wander. We literally didn't find a single pub, and ended up having dinner at a local Chinese restaurant.</p>
<p>We got the first train out the next morning back to Inverness along <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Line">the line</a> we were on the day before where we stopped for lunch, and caught the coach to Fort William.</p>
<p><strong>Thurso to Fort William: 218 miles including the coach (Running total: 642 miles)</strong></p>
<p>

<p>This day was the longest of the lot. We found a Wetherspoons in Fort William and stayed for a while...</p>
<p>In the next post I'll write about the scenic railway to Mallaig; and our trip to Glasgow and Edinburgh. <a href="http://www.jamesleighton.com/blog/2016/03/scotland-glasgow-to-thurso">Read it here</a>.</p>
