                <p>We're nearly twenty percent through 2013. I'm 23. I've spend many years considering getting my life into shape but I guess now is a good time before it's too late. In comes Me³ which is my fancy term for what I want to change and focus on for the next 90 days. Yes, this is going to be a 90 day challenge! 90 days from today ends June 1, 2013.</p>
<p>What does Me³ comprise of? Studying well, living well, playing well (Me.. cubed.. get it?! :P).</p>
<h3>Study</h3>
<p>I need to get into proper study habits. My last course broke my revision and exam skills because it was just coursework. This year I was thrown back at exams and didn't do terribly well (whilst I did quite well at the assessed coursework such as lab reports).</p>
<p>Since I have to resit most of the January exams I'm going to make a complete set of revision cards for each module last semester and this semester. Mind maps/spider diagrams were always useful back when I used to actually revise too so I'm going to see if they can still help me out. I guess I need to dedicate time each lectures each day to completing and reading my notes and stuff like textbooks. Not too much, I don't want to overload and burn out. The latest time to study would be 9pm each evening leaving a few hours spare to relax and do other things before bed time (preferably before midnight!)</p>
<h3>Living</h3>
<p>Last summer I managed to lose quite a bit of weight but that has pretty much gone out of the window since I've been living away at uni. I bought a gym membership for the year in October and I've gone three times. Three times.... Yeah, I should probably get on that. 2-3 times a week mostly on the days I don't have insane amounts of lectures or shifts a work will be enough to get me back on that wagon.</p>
<p>Recently we've been cooking more meals in bulk. Spaghetti bolognese, an amazing mixed vegetable mixture composed of tomato sauce, spices and other cheap things (Student, remember?). It's cheap and healthy. For under £4 we can get around 10 good sized servings out of one cooking session. A frozen pizza for a £1 sounds awesome, but honestly you'd rather not subject your body to it. If we already have delicious things frozen then it's easier to say no to junk food. As my day likes to put it, "eat less, move more".</p>
<h3>Playing</h3>
<p>My backlog of games is pretty huge. To round of my 90 day challenge I want to try and complete up to two games a month depending on my workload from uni and how close exams are getting (They start May 14th I believe). As I said, there is no point studying 24 hours a day; I'll just get bored and quit like I usually do when I try and go overboard with stuff. I want to enjoy my time at uni too. Spending quality time with my girlfriend, reading, watching movies, playing games all factor into this. I want do well, whilst enjoying myself.</p>
<h3>June 1st 2013</h3>
<p>What should I be like in ninety days? I should be feeling confident in the exams I've already sat, I should be feeling much happier and healthier within myself, and I should be making steady if somewhat slow progress though my backlog of games, I'll be ready to start the next ninety days up until We're nearly twenty percent through 2013. I'm 23. I've spend many years considering getting my life into shape but I guess now is a good time before it's too late. In comes Me³ which is my fancy term for what I want to change and focus on for the next 90 days. Yes, this is going to be a 90 day challenge! 90 days from today ends June 1, 2013.</p>
