                <p>I was going through my photos from uni that I took last year, and realised that people looking into accomodation at Bangor University might like to take a look at some of my photos of the inside of my halls. So here goes!</p>
<p><img alt="Reichal Halls" src="/images/20130624_075026.jpg"><br>
Outside of Reichel. To the right of this photo is the rest of the halls site.</p>
<p><img alt="My room looking quite sad." src="/images/20130624_084736.jpg"><br>
My room looking quite sad.</p>
<p>I was in a large room looking into the courtyard. Mind you, you'll mainly be looking into other peoples windows and the roof of the conference centre. These rooms are much bigger than any of the new building at the expense of not having your own bathroom. I was quite jealous of those with mountain views.</p>
<p>For me, paying an extra £17 a week for a bathroom didn't sound exciting. The prices have all gone up, so I don't know what the difference is for this year. Reichel isn't like the other halls, it's laid out a bit like a hotel along long corridors of rooms. Again, I didn't miss not having flats that much.</p>
<p>The kitchens vary wildly depending on where you get located. My kitchen was one of the smallest with 5/6 people in it. The big kitchens (on the corners) are much larger and have 8-10 people in them I think. Our kitchen had too many people, so I had to share a cupboard. More photos?</p>
<p><img alt="You can't see them in this photo, but the mountains look great with snow on them!" src="/images/20130623_145100.jpg"><br>

<p><img alt="The Fridge" src="/images/20130623_145046.jpg"><br>
The Fridge</p>
<p>Nothing too fancy. Reichel seems to have some of the newer appliances on site which is nice. Wifi has recently been installed into the halls and whilst it wasn't switched on when I left in June it is now! (I'm back for resits and staying in Adda.)</p>
<p>You'll get a proper key for your room in Reichel and a code to get through the front door. No fancy smart cards for us! Also handy as your room won't lock itself when you pop out for two minutes without your key. I recall it costing something like a tenner to security if you get locked out from your room and need them to let you in.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of Reichel is that it's slightly further than the rest of the halls from the university buildings (not that far really, but you'll notice it when it is tipping it down!). Other than that, the reduced cost makes it a great place to live (If you can go without the en-suite... which you most likely can!).</p>
<p>The sports centre is a two minute walk away and it costs something like £90 for a 9 month academic membership. Don't bother. I never went even though it was so close. If you're moving in to halls in September and you run Linux on your PC be sure to check out my post about how to authenticate with the network so you can access the internet to 'study'!</p>
<p>Time to finish off this post with some more photos. If you have any questions, feel free to tweet me @geekyjames or post a comment on this post and I'll get back to you!</p>
