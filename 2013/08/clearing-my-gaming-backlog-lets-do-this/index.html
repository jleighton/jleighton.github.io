                <p>I buy far too many games. It's pretty obvious what the problem is. I don't play them enough, then I get bored and buy more. It's quite silly really. <a href="http://completingthebacklog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/welcome.html">I'm not the only person either!</a></p>
<p><img alt="Backloggery" src="http://backloggery.com/zombieunicorn/sig.gif"></p>
<p>Anyway, it's time to get this backlog under control! I'm going to take part in Four in February again like I did this year. And I'm going to aim to play through 1-2 games each month depending my available free time each month. I'm not sure if I even want to take my PS3 with me back to uni given how many Steam/3DS games I have to complete without extra PS Plus games being added monthly. According to some tool I found online, it'd take me around 2000 hours to complete all of my steam games. Almost four years at ten hours a week...</p>
<p>I'm going to set a few rules for my personal challenge mainly to stop myself from having to play through games I detest and can't stand. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If I don't want to complete a game, I must play it through at least 3-6 hours from the start.<br>
    ...This allows me to get thoroughly into most games, by playing in generally 2x3 hour sessions. If I don't like it here, I'll mark it as null on Backloggery with the reason why in the comments.</li>
<li>For a game to be marked as completed on Backloggery I must at least complete the main storyline of a game (and each of the main DLC story-lines if I own them), and see the credits roll in some form. This marks the completion for my purposes. 100% is not a thing I believe in.</li>
<li>I cannot buy any new games until at least 5 games have been completed, or attempted and removed from Backloggery. This rule is active as of July 1st, and as such I need to complete 3 more games before I can purchase Pokemon X or Y.</li>
<li>Each month, I will post a blog post talking about my gaming experiences that month. The games I nulled, the reasons why and the games that I have completed. Basically a mini round-up of my gaming month.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently I am working through Dragon Quest 4 on the DS, and my next plan of attack is to play through some of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland</li>
<li>Big Bang Mini (although I suck at these type of games...)</li>
<li>Legend of Zelda (Gotta play those ambassador games at some point....)</li>
<li>The Dragon Quest games are pretty long, along with the Tingle game but I think I could complete these before October hits with a bit of luck. My choices are likely to change, by the way. Other games I want to try and tackle in the near future (basically, next year):</li>
<li>Final Fantasy Tactics A2 (It's like 80 hours long, argh. I do love it though)</li>
<li>The various Zelda games my 3DS seems to have acquired</li>
<li>The remainder of the DQ games I own (5, 6, 9)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls Games</li>
<li>Half Life Series (Don't judge me)</li>
<li>Gratuitous Space Battles /Gratuitous Tank Battles / Faster than Light<br>
    Wish me luck!</li>
</ul>
