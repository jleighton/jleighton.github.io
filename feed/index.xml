&lt;p&gt;Continuing to make an effort to get out and explore more we visited &lt;a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/shropshire-staffordshire/kinver-edge-and-the-rock-houses"&gt;Kinver Edge and the Kinver Rock Houses&lt;/a&gt; near to Stourbridge, West Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2024/03/img_2909-edited.jpg" class="wp-image-1827" style="width: 50%;" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The estate is run by the National Trust who have been restoring the 'Holy Austin Rock Houses' since the early 1990s. You can walk around the heathland for free and parking was free in the layby on Compton Road. There are also several National Trust car parks if the onstreet parking is full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, we walked the '&lt;a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/shropshire-staffordshire/kinver-edge-and-the-rock-houses/woodland-trail"&gt;Woodland Trail&lt;/a&gt;' (the orange signposted path) as we were not fancying a five mile walk today! The scenery was breathtaking (as was the climb but I digress) as we made our way up the hill towards the iron age hill fort which sits about 540 feet above sea level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:gallery --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ancient iron age hill fort at the top of Kinver Edge is well worth the short trek! On a clear day like the day we went you can literally see miles in every direction and there is even a handy reference map provided by the local Rotary Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we'd had enough of the view we continued down the orange path which us towards the Rock Houses themselves. We paid our entrance fees of £7.50 each then meandered along a path around the base of the Rock Houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Steve we learned some of the history of the rock houses, the conditions they lived in and that the second house on the lower level is closed off during winter due to a colony of bats taking up residence. The last human residents moved out as late as 1963!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In years gone by industries thrived in this area so people moved in. As those fortunes waned, a tea rooms was opened I suppose as a means to survive. There was even a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinver_Light_Railway"&gt;tram link&lt;/a&gt; to nearby Amblecote to bring in the sightseeers (and freight) which operated between 1901 and 1930.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn't try the modern day tea rooms as it was 11am and we just weren't hungry so no reviews of that. However it was still early so we carried on to nearby Bewdley for lunch and a mooch about but that's for a different blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Mar 2024 18:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2024-03-09:/2024/03/kinver-edge-and-the-rock-houses/</guid><category>Adventures</category><category>National Trust</category></item><item><title>Thoughts on ActivityPub and the Fediverse</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2024/03/thoughts-on-activitypub-and-the-fediverse/</link><description>&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent explosion of the Fediverse has been great to see - social media out of the grips of billionaires! &lt;a href="https://mastodon.org.uk/@semaj"&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; replaces Twitter (X? Nope.), Pixelfed replaces Instagram, &lt;a href="https://ramblingreaders.org/user/Semaj"&gt;BookWyrm&lt;/a&gt; replaces Good Reads. These services are all based on a specification called &lt;a href="https://activitypub.rocks/"&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; and that means you can follow my BookWyrm account from Mastodon and get my reading updates and reviews in your standard timeline. All very nifty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue I have is that instead of trusting the Musks and Zuckerbergs of the world, unless you're running your own instances you are now reliant on the benevolence of a someone with potentially unknown motives or resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will the instance you choose be around next week? How secure is the instance? Can you get your data back if the instance goes dark? These and more questions make the ActivityPub Fediverse confusing and off putting to 'normal' people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing an instance? The question that everybody asked in 2023 when Musk truly jumped the shark! It is terribly confusing too. Should I go for a generic instance? Can I talk about things other than the designated topic if I chose a more specialist instance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You absolutely can self-host if you want to. That's not something I'm particularly interested in these days though. Mastodon is heavy on resources and technology. I just want to have fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newsgroups got this right in my opinion. You posted to a group, other servers mirrored that content, and other people could reply on their own servers and you eventually saw this when everything synced up. Modernise this, and I think that is the future of the fediverse. I want one account that all my friends can follow, and then they can subscribe to any or all of the applications that post into that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I have numerous 'identities' on the Fediverse: Mastodon, BookWyrm, this blog too. If you want all my updates, you follow them all manually. If I want to change instances, I can 'move' my followers but but content stays put on the old server. That seriously sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just think it would be a lot more interesting if you could just follow 'me', my content stayed on servers I controlled at all times, and there was no nonsense about what instance you should pick. Ha. That actually sounds a lot like why I still blog in 2024.... :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a spare morning with not a lot to do before a family event in South Wales recently so we visited &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrhyd_Falls"&gt;Henrhyd Falls&lt;/a&gt; which is the tallest waterfall in South Wales with a drop of 90 feet. Part of my &lt;a href="https://semaj.me.uk/2023/12/23/doing-things-differently-in-2024-foundations/"&gt;yearly theme&lt;/a&gt; was to get out and see more things and this was exactly the sort of adventure we had in mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is found &lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ND7ySnnmzy2qcTKi7"&gt;near Ceolbren&lt;/a&gt; in what is known as 'Waterfall Country' about 30-40 minutes drive from Swansea. It had been raining quite a lot the week before so we were in for a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:image {"id":1731,"aspectRatio":"16/9","scale":"cover","sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --&gt;

&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Me standing behind the waterfall&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The free National Trust &lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ND7ySnnmzy2qcTKi7"&gt;car park&lt;/a&gt; is small with space for maybe 15-20 cars. There is a farm directly next door who will let you park for £5 but in February this wasn't a problem. The narrow access route from the village plus parking would be a fun during the peak summer months though. There was a snack bar selling food and drinks that opened (around 11am) during our visit in the overflow parking but I didn't check to see if they were cash only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from the carpark you descend down into the valley- the path down is very steep. Once you make it to the bottom of the valley, make a left turn and walk towards to sound of the raging waterfall. Take a right to enjoy a &lt;a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/wales/bannau-brycheiniog-brecon-beacons/henrhyd-falls-and-nant-llech-walk"&gt;walk down the river&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll cross over a wooden bridge and more steep stairs and slowly the waterfall will come into view. We were lucky it was so quiet and managed to get behind the falls before anyone else came down the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The noise was absolutely incredible, and it was really humbling to realise just how much power was in the water coming down the hillside. We took some fun photos, and made our way slowly back down the path. The climb was a killer! It's made me realise just how out of shape I am and has kicked off some thoughts about making new habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The round trip walk from the car park to the waterfall is about 0.66 miles with an elevation gain of \~250 feet (according to my Apple Watch)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My blog has been hosted on Micro.blog since July after I last moved from GitHub pages. Since then, the fediverse has boomed, but I felt cut off in Micro.blog. They don't support likes or easy reblogs (by design) so I eventually split Microblog and Mastodon into two accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I felt like I was neglecting my blog, so here I am back on hosted Wordpress. This should support sending posts out to fediverse, but I still need to understand how that works. I think I also enabled cross-posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 25 Feb 2024 18:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2024-02-25:/2024/02/moving-the-blog-again/</guid><category>Tech Thoughts</category><category>blog</category></item><item><title>Building Foundations - Doing things differently in 2024 - Foundations</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2023/12/doing-things-differently-in-2024-foundations/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For 2024 my  theme is going to be 'foundations'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to lay the foundations of a better me. I know I need to get healthier (sooner rather than later!) and therefore these are the things I want to focus on next year to get me closer to my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Move More 🚶‍♂️&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home is a blessing. However it can also mean I don't leave the house for days at a time. I need to find reasons to get out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving more could just be a walk around the block, it might be active exercise, or it might be going and seeing a National Trust property with the wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the year, my average metric in Apple Health should all show a postive trend. It doesn't matter if they are small, just that the trend is postive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Commit More 🎭&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a local board game group a few months ago who were super inclusive and I had a lot of fun playing with. Then I never went back. I was too 'busy' or 'tired'. 🤨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, I should commit to more activities and events to help me get out, meet new people, and move more. (See point 1 👀)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enjoy my time more ⌚&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to read more books, play more games, and spend more quality time with my loved ones. I think it means limiting doom scrolling opportunities.. Instead of scrolling through discord, mastodon, and the news mindlessly I should pick up my e-reader, go for a walk (See point 1 👀), or play a board game with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024 I want to read more books, and complete more games than I did in 2023 (It's a pretty low bar!) and I want to spend less time on things that quite literally have no impact on me and my life (Hi, Discord Drama.)&lt;/p&gt;

It is a fantastic corner of the internet, and I am happy to host my blog here for the forseeable future. The people here are interesting, funny and nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2024/02/abca3-favicon-192.png" class="x" width="192" height="192" alt="Microblog Logo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been using their full mastodon intergration for the last six months or so, and it was ok. It was made clear it isn't a full client, and that is certainly true. Your posts are sent out to the fediverse but MB doesn't show boosts, or likes so unless people reply it is almost impossible to know how your posts are doing. You also don't get to see your follower count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2024/02/99f93-wordmark-black-text.png" width="314" height="80" alt="Mastodon Logo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I'd get over it but alas I couldn't. Today I migrated my MB masto account back to mastodon.org.uk. Time to see how crossposting goes over the next six months!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2023 12:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2023-12-23:/2023/12/thoughts-on-microblog-and-mastodon/</guid><category>Tech Thoughts</category></item><item><title>Cosy Nights</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2023/12/cosy-nights/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Cosy night playing co-op Stardew Valley and catching up on [Staying in Podcast](https://www.stayinginpodcast.com/)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 20:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2023-12-20:/2023/12/cosy-nights/</guid><category>gaming</category></item><item><title>Some quick thoughts on the CRKD NitroDeck for Switch</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2023/11/some-quick-thoughts-on-the-crkd-nitrodeck-for-switch/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks with the NitroDeck switch grip… 🎮&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s still feeling very comfortable, I don’t find the right stick awkward at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rumble motor is whiny and will annoy everyone in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to use it as a wired controller is actually quite nifty. I used this last week when I was travelling (in conjunction with a Genki dock)&lt;/p&gt;

I’m using this to cut down on Discord, Reddit and Instagram during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not full proof, as you can simply change the focus mode to load the app. However I’ve found that being dumped back at the Home Screen reminded me I should probably do some work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Part 1 - Focus Modes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, you’ll already need to be using Focus Modes. I have a focus called “Work” that mutes some notifications, changes the wallpaper on my phone and watch, and hides the majority of the pages of my home screens. We’ll be using this focus mode shortly, so remember what you’ve called it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![](/images/2024/02/cdb85-8f559d7607.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Part 2 - Shortcuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the shortcut in the following screenshot , or [download mine here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e5469204874d4ffaae786a1fac5b3124). This shortcut checks the current focus mode, then runs a conditional check if it is equal to “Work”. If it’s work time, it dumps you back to Home Screen (as you can’t close apps with Shortcuts), if it’s not work time, you’re free to use the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could probably take this further and use another app to count open attempts or something like that but I haven’t bothered yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![](/images/2024/02/029ca-3f14b6081b.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Part 3 - Automations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it all work, open the Shortcuts app and find the automations tab. From here create a new automation, and look for ‘App’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an automation based on the application you’re trying to control, select ‘Run Immediately’, don’t select Notify when run. Tap Next, then select your discord shortcut from Part 2 in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![](/images/2024/02/b58fe-media.jpg)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done this, try and open the app whilst the focus is active. You’ll be dumped back to your Home Screen and reminded about making better choices.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 18:02:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2023-10-23:/2023/10/how-to-use-shortcuts-and-focus-modes-to-help-with-procrastination/</guid><category>Uncategorized</category></item><item><title>Locking down apps to help with procrastination (Apple Edition)</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2023/10/locking-down-apps-to-help-with-procrastination-apple-edition/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I block myself from wasting time on Discord, Reddit, and other non productive apps using Shortcuts, Automations, and Focus Modes on iPad and iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with creating the shortcut. You can borrow mine [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6d8a7500b0d84452896f64814db47bbd).&lt;/p&gt;

These are useful to create a 'home' entity that can be used to turn off lights and smart plugs when everyone leaves the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need to assign each user in your home assistant install a device, so we know their current location. Once this is done, we can create an automation based on the entity of 'zone.home'. This seems to return an numeric count of the number of people within the zone, so we'll be leverging this in an automation as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will run the actions when zome.home = 0 for 3 minutes. In my case, this turns off Hue lights and a couple of smart plugs. It also sends me a mobile alert, but I will likely remove this in a few days once I know it's working well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Turn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lights&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Turn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;when&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After losing access to Foresty CMS, I fell out of love with Jekyll. Whilst I love that it cost me £0, it was a nightmare to actually post anything. So I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've migrated things to Micro.blog now, hoping that I might post a bit more! Sorry, not sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been so busy in 2023 that we've not stopped to appreciate all the things we've done. Time is flying, and it would be nice to write down some of the fun things we've done.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2023 09:16:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2023-07-16:/2023/07/new-blog-sunday/</guid><category>life</category></item><item><title>2023</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2022/12/2023/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to 2023, these are the key habits I want to instill in my day to day life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Listening to more audio content (audio books, podcasts, and music)&lt;br&gt;
- Walking more (probably whilst listening to audio content)&lt;br&gt;
- Less time unconsciously ‘consuming’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posted on Mastodon recently that my theme for 2023 is ‘Distraction Free’, and these habits should help me achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to more audio content is key. Working from home works great for me, but I sometimes find myself just sat in silence staring at whatever work I am doing. When this happens, I have a tendency to check the news, reddit, or discord… More music, podcasts, and audio books should help here to keep me engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking more has a physical health benefit, but should mean I leave the house more often. Working from home full time has meant some weeks when the weather has been ‘not great’, I literally won’t leave the house for days at a time like some kind of gremlin. That needs to change and getting out more should help on days when I am struggling to focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recently removed social media applications from my phone - most of them are still on my iPad but that means I have to consciously find my iPad (hoping I charged it) to to use them which cuts down on the time I scroll through posts on twitter, mastodon, and instagram. I actually did this a few weeks ago, and the impact is noticeable. I can’t just ‘check the feeds’ right before bed. It’s great. You should all do this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2022-12-28:/2022/12/2023/</guid><category>health, life</category></item><item><title>Samsung TV - Hospitality Mode</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2022/12/samsung-tv-hospitality-mode/</link><description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another post in my series of 'if I don't document it, I will forget how to do this again in 2 years time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the Hospitality Mode of Samsung TVs, press the following buttons in order: Mute 1 1 9 Enter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Hospitality Mode on a Samsung H5000TV](/images/2024/02/74cc7-f43bccd670.jpg "Hospitality Mode on a Samsung TV")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mode lets you set fun options like automatically turning on the TV when it receives power (like they do in hotel rooms!) which works nicely with a smart plug. You can also set volume limits (probably handy if you have kids), and the default input source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've finished messing around, turn your TV off and on again to exit the hospitality mode menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was tested on an ancient Samsung 40H5000 TV, and may not work or require different steps on TVS that aren't nearly a decade old!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2022 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2022-12-28:/2022/12/samsung-tv-hospitality-mode/</guid><category>howto</category></item><item><title>How to create a Rising Falling Temperature Trend Indicator in Home Assistant</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2022/08/home-assistant-rising-falling-temperature/</link><description>&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet another post in my series of 'if I don't document it, I will forget how to do this again in 2 years time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wanted a visual indicator as to whether the temperature in our home was rising and falling. This is possible with Home Assistant but the configuration is a bit cumbersome (like most of Home Assistant, honestly...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:image {"id":1604} --&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2024/02/04fe6-1fe1241847.png" class="wp-image-1604" alt="Screenshot of HomeAssistant Dashboard showing the entities described in this post"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take note of the names of the temperature sensors you want to create Rising/Falling entities for. In my case, I will be creating three for bedroom, living room, and study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take your three temperature sensors, and create a &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/trend/"&gt;trend entity&lt;/a&gt; for each within your configuration.yaml file. Keep the names sensible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create an 'on/off' trend sensor which shows 'on' if the temperature is raising and off if the temperature is falling. You can set a minimum change on the trend sensor so minor fluctations are ignored, but the default configuration works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"large"} --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/2024/02/efa40-67c8e3b1df.png%20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will use this to create a &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/"&gt;template sensor&lt;/a&gt; for each new trend sensor. This will let us customise the text so it says Rising or Falling instead of On or off and also allow us to set a custom entity icon. Once again, this goes in your configuration.yaml file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;span class="x"&gt;   mdi:thermometer-chevron-down&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cp"&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the trend sensor is 'on', then the template will return 'Rising' and set the icon to 'mdi:thermometer-chevron-up'. In all other cases, it will return 'Falling' and set the icon to 'mdi:thermometer-chevron-down'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure all your conditional statements refer to the correct sensor! You might pull your hair out for half an hour if you don't.... :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Multi account containers ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ "Multi Account Containers Firefox Addon")in Firefox are fantastic. They let you separate your browsing into individual silos which means Google can't get track you as effectively across the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it was a pain to get Youtube to log in successfully even after adding google.com, youtube.com, accounts.google.com to the Google container site list. Every attempt to sign in bounced off to a 500 server error page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is to add 'accounts.youtube.com' to the container site list too. This is part of the redirect when you sign into Youtube and will cause your login to fail if it tries to load outside of the google container where all the delicious cookies are!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next issue is there is no easy way to add ad-hoc URLs to a site list of a container. To get around this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Open accounts.youtube.com -you will see a 404 error but that is fine for our purposes&lt;br&gt;
2. Click Always Open in Container in the address bar&lt;br&gt;
3. Select your Google container&lt;br&gt;
4. Tick 'Remember my Decision for this site'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you will be able to successfully log in to YouTube!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Windows, this was really easy. You would just tick 'Listen to this device' in device properties , you'd be away and listening to your USB Capture Card audio. I do this quite a lot as my monitor doesn't have speakers, and I like to listen to various other things whilst I am playing my Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most things in Linux, it's easy when you know how.... These instructions should work for any distro that uses Pulse Audio. I'm using Pop_OS is basically Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a loopback device. Take note of the device ID that is returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![](/images/2024/02/7299a-935d47842c.png){:.responsiveimg80}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, open Pulse Audio Volume control (pavucontrol). You should see your new loopback device. All you need to do now is select which device you want to hear it through which in my case is my SteelSeries headset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've always loved [RSS feeds](https://rss.com/blog/how-do-rss-feeds-work/ "RSS Feeds"). From back in the early days when podcasting was the new cool thing to the halycon days of Google Reader right up to the current day when I think everyone should be using RSS feeds to avoid the plague that is modern websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS feeds give control back to the user and help limit user tracking because you are no longer reading the articles directly in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Feed Logo](/images/2024/02/dfc65-5f1cef605e.png){:.responsiveimg80}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most sites have an RSS feed (even if they don't publicise it) because most content management systems produce one. Sometimes you just need to check the section of the source code to find the RSS link - it's usually pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, RSS feeds are starting to dissappear as as I mentioned above, they limit the amount of user tracking a website can do. However I thought I would share the feeds I am currently subscribed to in my RSS reader to try and do my bit to help RSS survive. First though, how can you read RSS feeds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use a service like [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/home "The Old Reader") which is a pretty decent replacement for Google Reader (RIP) or you can use local apps like gPodder, [Thunderbird](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-subscribe-news-feeds-and-blogs "Thunderbird"), and so on. Currently I am using [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/ "NetNewsWire") which syncs between my tablet and phone using iCloud (I am slowly moving away from hosted services like The Old Reader, Notion, etc - see [this post](https://www.jamesleighton.com/2021/12/29/state-of-the-apps) for the background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give you access to the older sound control panel screens. I needed this as I was trying to access the 'Listen' mode on a capture card/line in device, and couldn't find any other way of doing this in Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the old 'Sound' control panel screen in Windows 11:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![](/images/2024/02/4da62-566e8f4163.png)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is above \[GamerTag\]'s Restrictions Error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This started occuring to me after I'd uploaded to Windows 11. I was unable to download Fallout 4 from PC Gamepass,as apparently my account had content restrictions applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy way I fixed this was to sign out of the Xbox app, and sign back in. Once I did this, I was able to download Fallout 4 without further issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few things have changed over the last 12 months since I wrote the last version of &lt;a href="_wp_link_placeholder"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. I've managed to continue using Firefox for both work and personal use and hardly touch Chrome at all anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still rocking a PiHole to block ads at home, and can't see this changing anytime soon. I am looking into ways to use the PiHole outside of home, but I think it would just be easier to use something like &lt;a href="https://nextdns.io/"&gt;NextDNS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fastmail is still our email platform of choice, and Apple Music still doesn't (and won't ever, realistically) support Last.fm so we're still using Spotify Premium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note Taking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For notes, I have settled on [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) syncronised using iCloud Drive. This has the benefits of being free, and also allowing my notes to exist as plain markdown files if I ever want to migrate to another note system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plugin system is great. I use [Advance Tables](https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian), [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban), and Daily notes (core plugin) extensively:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Tables suck (a lot) in Markdown, and the advanced tables plugin takes away all the pain. It even makes them pretty for you.&lt;br&gt;
* I use Kanban's to plan projects. It's handy having them in the same place as all my notes. This has replaced my self hosted instance of Kanboard.&lt;br&gt;
* Daily Notes are great for reflection. I'm alternating between using a [theme system journal](https://www.themesystem.com/) and Obsidian for this, and I haven't really decided which way to go yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;### Life Logging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still using [Exist](https://www.jamesleighton.com/tag/existio/) (you should sign up for a [free month](https://exist.io/?referred_by=jamesleighton)!) to track my daily vitals, along side InfluxDB/Grafana to [track my game time](https://www.jamesleighton.com/2020/04/12/influxdb-to-exist-gaming-time). Not much has changed in this department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;### Task Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, I use [Asana](https://asana.com/) as it's what we use. It works well for multiorganisation projects, and gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, I am back on [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) and this is forming a big part of my theme for 2022 which is the 'Year of Focus'. I am creating lists of things I would like to focus on for the next week, month, and quarter and moving items through the lists until they get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a theme blog post coming soon(ish)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 15:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2021-12-29:/2021/12/state-of-the-apps-for-2021/</guid><category>exist.io, state of the apps</category></item><item><title>How to make Discord actually display your Xbox Live status</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2021/11/how-to-make-discord-actually-display-your-xbox-live-status/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've been unable to make the Discord / Xbox Live integration work since I got my Xbox earlier in the year. I tried unlinking, re-linking, and nothing worked. I gave up for a while but managed to get it working this week. Here is how to get your discord account to show your Xbox live status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### On the Xbox:&lt;br&gt;
- Unlink Discord in Settings&amp;gt;Account&amp;gt;Linked Social Accounts if you already have it linked.&lt;br&gt;
- Go to Settings&amp;gt;Privacy &amp;amp; Online Safety and ensure your profile settings are set to Adult - Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### In your discord settings (on PC):&lt;br&gt;
- Go Settings&amp;gt;Connections.&lt;br&gt;
- Reconnect Xbox Live in here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, all your friends should be able to see just how long you've been exploring Mexico for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last year, I moved my personal stuff away from Gmail and Google Calendar (see Fastmail below) so it felt fitting to try a life without Chrome as well. Firefox is not as fast as Chrome, but it more than does everything I need it to. Plus, it helps with stopping the google monopoly of the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to use Notion, but didn't use the advanced features like the inbuilt database tools enough to justify the cost. Joplin is a free (open source) markdown note taking application that I am using to write this post. It can sync via a variety of backends; I use the S3 backend with backblaze but it also supports Dropbox, Onedrive, Webdav and just using a file system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's great. I can't recommend it enough, and I am really looking forward to seeing what the new plugin interface allows people to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete PC backup + S3 compatible storage service for an affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the S3 compatible bucket storage for rclone on my servers, as well as a bucket for Joplin notes. This costs me about $0.40 a month, the PC backup is US$6/month and worth it for the peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

Here is how I spent some of it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# Games&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played 66 games for longer than half an hour in 2020 and played at least a few seconds of 109 games in total. Out of my top 9 games, only 2 were released in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of my top 66 games, I played each for an average of 6h12m (drastically dragged higher by animal crossing)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="image-caption"&gt;![Top Nine Games](/images/2024/02/0ecb5-294146688d.png){:class="img-fluid" :alt="Top Nine Games"}&lt;br&gt;
*Top Nine Games*&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. **Animal Crossing New Horizons** (78h55m) - I played every few days from March to early October when my save got corrupted and Nintendo refused to let me download the cloud backup. I had a great time, but I can't face going back and starting a new island yet.&lt;br&gt;
2. **Dragon Quest XI** **S** (29h10m) - I got this game for Christmas 2019 and completed it mere days before Animal Crossing monopolised my gaming time. An awesome game. I still need to go back and finish the Tockington Shrines, as well as the post game Act 3.&lt;br&gt;
3. **Forza Horizon 4** (16h03m) - A late contender, I upgraded my PC in November and subscribed to Xbox Game Pass for PC. Forza Horizon 4 is the ultimate chill racing game - Wanna drive fast? Hit the speed traps! Wanna get massive air? Go find the danger signs and jump off. I can lose hours at a time, and never feel bored. I think this will be making an appearance on this list again in twelve months time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games that missed the top 9 include Open TTD, Digimon Cyber Sleuth, Fantasy Life, Super Mario 3D All-Stars, Train Simulator. Perhaps they'll make an appearance next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;# Movies &amp;amp; TV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Lockdown #1, we watched the Marvel Cinematic Universe in release order from Iron Man to Avenger's End Game. I'd previously watched a handful of the films, but watching them all back to back over 4 weeks was pretty special. I thoroughly recommend getting yourself sat in front of Disney+ and watch these films on a schedule for the next month. Or three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also rewatched Bojack Horseman, Anthony Bourdain's amazing Parts Unknown and too many Studio Ghibli movies to remember. It was a pretty fantastic year for catching up on TV shows and Movies all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lets me use the same todo list between my linux desktop, and iOS mobile devices (using the built in stock reminders app)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Vdirsyncer Config&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using [vdirsyncer](https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer) to connect to Fastmail's servers and before the synchronisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```[general]&lt;br&gt;
status_path = "\~/.vdirsyncer/status/"&lt;br&gt;
[pair fastmail]&lt;br&gt;
a = "local"&lt;br&gt;
b = "cal"&lt;br&gt;
collections = ["from a", "from b"]&lt;br&gt;
[storage cal]&lt;br&gt;
type = "caldav"&lt;br&gt;
url = "https://caldav.messagingengine.com/"&lt;br&gt;
username = "username@fastmail.com"&lt;br&gt;
password = "fastmail-app-specific-password"&lt;br&gt;
[storage local]&lt;br&gt;
type = "filesystem"&lt;br&gt;
path = "\~/.vdirsyncer/fastmail"&lt;br&gt;
fileext = ".ics"&lt;br&gt;
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Todoman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Todoman](https://github.com/pimutils/todoman) is a terminal reminder/todo app that can work with vdirsyncer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="image-caption"&gt;![todoman.png](/images/2024/02/d06bc-1f40bb3640.png){:class="img-fluid" :alt="Todoman Output in Terminal"}&lt;br&gt;
*Todoman Output in Terminal*&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my configuration for todoman that points it at the folders created by vdirsyncer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```[main]&lt;br&gt;
# A glob expression which matches all directories relevant&lt;br&gt;
path = \~/.vdirsyncer/fastmail/path-for-reminders-cal&lt;br&gt;
date_format = %Y-%m-%d&lt;br&gt;
time_format = %H:%M&lt;br&gt;
default_list = reminders-cal-id (same as the folder, see below...)&lt;br&gt;
default_due = 48&lt;br&gt;
humanize = true&lt;br&gt;
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To figure out which calendar is the ical reminders feed you can take a look in \~/.vdirsyncer/fastmail. There should be a folder for each of your Fastmail calenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look through the ICS files that you find and you'll find something similar to the this example. You want to use the directory name of the folder that contains your VTODO's - use the directory name for the default_list above as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```BEGIN:VCALENDAR&lt;br&gt;
CALSCALE:GREGORIAN&lt;br&gt;

```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Calendar Support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to using a terminal calendar tool like Calcurse or [Khal](https://github.com/pimutils/khal) but I have not set these up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Automating with Cron&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To automate synchronisation, I used cron. Add the following via `crontab -e` to run the sync every 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```*/15 * * * * /home/james/.local/bin/vdirsyncer sync &amp;gt; /dev/null```&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Sep 2020 18:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2020-09-05:/2020/09/todoman-reminder-sync-for-fastmail/</guid><category>howto</category></item><item><title>Level 11 - Games I Played in August 2020</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2020/09/level-11-games-i-played-in-august-2020/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;**Super Nintendo Online - Yoshi's Island - 10h35m**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![yoshi island](/images/2024/02/187c2-763d8a739c.jpg){:class="img-fluid" :alt="Yoshi's Island"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set out to complete Yoshi's Island (SNES) this month and managed to complete that goal! Another one off the backlog... since I originally bought the GBA version on the WiiU virtual console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great game but the difficulty curve towards the end is ridiculously steep. It rewards you when you (eventually) get it right in a way that modern Nintendo games don't. I should probably play Super Mario World soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - 6h31m**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="image-caption"&gt;![witcher3](/images/2024/02/bcffd-c9d9b0d4df.jpg){:class="img-fluid" :alt="The Witcher 3"}&lt;br&gt;
*The Witcher 3*&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought the PC version this month as it hit my price threshold of a tenner. Transferring my save over from the Switch was as easy as logging into Steam. It is obviously a lot prettier on PC but the lack of portability isn't exactly a problem right now due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am aiming to finish the main story of the base game by the end of year but I suppose I will get sidetracked! I really enjoyed the Netflix show, and have been reading through the books this year so more Witcher lore is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Animal Crossing: New Horizons: 5h40m**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played a bit more Animal Crossing than I had been in recent months. I am still basically done with my island but I am going back for events such as the fireworks and bug catching contests.I have a plan to terraform my island and we'll see if I stick to it next month.. the teraforming UI is terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Nintendo will release an update that has stuff like the islands from New Leaf. As it stands, my island just seems a bit dull with nothing to actually do.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 04 Sep 2020 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2020-09-04:/2020/09/level-11-games-i-played-in-august-2020/</guid><category>gaming</category></item><item><title>Writing a py3bar module to display MQTT temperature data</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2020/08/writing-a-py3bar-module-to-display-mqtt-temperature-data/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started using the [i3 Window manager](https://i3wm.org/) and have swapped the bar from the standard bar to py3bar as it is easily extendible using python scripts and is also fully compatible with your existing i3bar configuration. You can swap to it with one change of your i3config and it will just work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The i3 status bar is a great place to show useful information and I thought it would be handy to show the temperature of my living room which is stored in MQTT at Adafruit.io. The logic is split into two parts: The first retrieves the temperature from the MQTT server and spits it out into a text file and the second part is the py3bar module that renders the temperature to the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2020/08/ea99e-8347f040ab.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1779" width="656" height="340" alt="Temperature Data on my i3 Bar" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Temperature Data on my i3 Bar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by reading their documentation on [creating custom modules](https://py3status.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing_modules.html) as it goes into more details about the required file paths, and has a sample 'Hello World' module to try out as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this could easily be extended to control smart lights or plugs and other IOT things as well. Python in the system bar is neat. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part 1 - fetch-temperature.py&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script is launched at login by i3 by adding this to your i3config:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```bash&lt;br&gt;
exec --no-startup-id python3 /home/user/path/to/fetch-temperature.py &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The python code is fairly simple and only relies on [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/). It reads out the data and stores it in a plain text file under .config (to keep things tidy)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```python&lt;br&gt;
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt&lt;br&gt;
import paho.mqtt.subscribe as subscribe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc):&lt;br&gt;
print("Connected with result code "+str(rc))&lt;br&gt;
client.subscribe("mqtt/feed/here")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;def on_message_print(client, userdata, message):&lt;br&gt;
temp = message.payload&lt;br&gt;
temp = temp.decode("utf-8")&lt;br&gt;
#print("%s" % ( temp))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f = open("/home/james/.config/temperature.txt", "w")&lt;br&gt;
f.write(temp)&lt;br&gt;
f.close()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;client = mqtt.Client()&lt;br&gt;
client.username_pw_set(username="username",password="adafruitio_api_key")&lt;br&gt;
client.connect("io.adafruit.com",1883,60)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;client.on_connect = on_connect&lt;br&gt;
client.on_message = on_message_print&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;client.loop_forever()&lt;br&gt;
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Part 2 - Py3Bar Module&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the py3bar module and deals with displaying the temperature on the bar itself. It reads in the temperature.txt, converts it to a number, rounds it and converts it back to a string ready to print to the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data is found it will expire in 300 seconds and when data is not found it will expire and refresh in 15 seconds. My sensor posts to MQTT every 5 minutes so this works well. The only time that the file does not exist is on first run or when it is manually deleted. If this happens the bar will check every 15 seconds waiting for a new file to be created by the script in Part 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should probably add some more error checking here in case the file contains things other than a simple number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```python&lt;br&gt;
class Py3status:&lt;br&gt;
def flat_temperature(self):&lt;br&gt;
while True:&lt;br&gt;
try:&lt;br&gt;
#open and read the file after the appending:&lt;br&gt;
f = open("/home/james/.config/temperature.txt", "r")&lt;br&gt;
temp = f.read()&lt;br&gt;
temp = float(temp)&lt;br&gt;
temp = round(temp, 2)&lt;br&gt;
temp = str(temp)&lt;br&gt;
return {&lt;br&gt;
'full_text': temp,&lt;br&gt;
'cached_until': self.py3.time_in(300)&lt;br&gt;
}&lt;br&gt;
except IOError:&lt;br&gt;
return {&lt;br&gt;
'full_text': "Waiting for data",&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went for [Ubuntu 20.04][4] because I am lazy, and decided that was probably the course of least resistance. I was right (mostly!), and I will write some blog posts detailing what worked well, and what needed tweaks/changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installer managed to install the proprietary Nvidia drivers with no fuss. Holy crap, I remember spending days getting graphics cards working back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam now has a compatibility layer called [Proton][2], so I got that installed. I still need to spend some more time in Windows games, but looking through the Proton page, it looks good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Native Linux games such Civ 5, Left 4 Dead 2 ran exactly how I would expect them to for my system (Intel Core i5-2320 CPU @ 3.00GHz, &amp;amp; GeForce GTX 970).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played a bit of Age of Empires 2, and that worked fine. Since I don't play PC games made after around 2015, I think I will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I don't want to write about all these games that I played! A few short mentions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- 51 Worldwide Games is awesome for local co-op play... Ludo is fun, Blackjack is great, and Toy Baseball is just ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;
- Prison Architect's campaign was short but excellent. I should probably try build some more prisons!&lt;br&gt;
- Download the Mobile to PC mod pack for GTA VC. It looks fucking fantastic running at 4k60fps!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jul 2020 15:55:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2020-07-06:/2020/07/level-9-games-i-played-in-june-2020/</guid><category>gaming</category></item><item><title>Setup a VPN using Zerotier and a Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2020/05/16/setup-a-vpn.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Redirection Post&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 23:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2020-05-16:/2020/05/16/setup-a-vpn.html</guid><category>How To</category><category>Projects</category><category>Networking</category></item><item><title>Setup a VPN using Zerotier and a Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2020/05/vpn-using-zerotier-and-a-raspberry-pi/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This post aims to document a project that I setup and use every day. It is primarily to help me in the future when I want to set it up again! I hope you find it useful for your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run a [Pihole](https://pi-hole.net/) ad blocker on my home network, and it is great. It blocks a ton of crap at the network level including ads, telemetry and other nasties. It stops working when I leave home which isn't great. I used to run an OpenVPN server which was fine but I don't have a static IP. This meant it regularly broke for my wife so I had to find a new solution...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a P2P VPN application called Zerotiert hat creates a secure, encrypted virtual LAN (local area network) over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means I can connect to my ZeroTier network via the iOS / Android / Windows / iOS apps and effectively be on my home network, therefore the PiHole is available to all my devices as long as they're connected to ZeroTier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a bit of routing magic via iptables on the Pi I can direct all my traffic via ZeroTier and out to the internet via my home connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, install ZeroTier on the computer you're going to leave on at home all the time. My Pihole was already running on a Pi3, so I used that. Follow their instructions to create your network- Make sure your ZeroTier network used a range that won't clash with your existing networks. Once you have basic connectivity working, we can move on to routing packets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need to add some routes to your ZeroTier network on my.zerotier.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![/images/zt-managed-routes.png](/images/zt-managed-routes.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**0.0.0.0/0** is the default route to the internet, and should point to the ZeroTier IP address belonging to your Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**192.168.1.0/24** is the IP range of my home network, and should point to the ZeroTier IP address belong to the Pi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**168.168.8.0/24** is the IP range of my travel router (more on that in another post); this route points to the ZeroTier IP address belonging to the router. I have similar forwarding rules setup on this router, which means anything I connect to it such my Nintendo Switch, or Chromecast are automatically tunneled home via Zerotier. I tested this with Netflix and All4 and both worked perfectly when I was working in France earlier in the year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should be able to connect to ZeroTier over mobile data and connect to IP addresses in your local network. Try your router's admin interface!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the routes are setup, it is time to fiddle with iptables. Honestly, it's best to this connected to the Pi via a serial shell, or just hook up a keyboard/mouse and a screen. You're gonna mess this up at least once and break connectivity ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin by enabling IP forwarding on the Pi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, create the forwarding rules on the Pi; These enable forwarding between eth0 on the Pi (you are using ethernet and not wifi, right?) and the Zerotier interface.&lt;br&gt;
Replace ZT_INTERFACE with the local ZeroTier interface name - you can get this from ifconfig. In my case, the interface is called ztrtastctq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o ZT_INTERFACE -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i ZT_INTERFACE -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, you should be able to test again. Your traffic should be reaching the interface via your home connection, so connect via mobile data and see what your [IP address](http://www.whatismyipaddress.com) is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is working, it's time to save the iptables rules so they persist over the next reboot. To do this, run the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install iptables-persistent
sudo iptables-save &amp;gt; /etc/iptables/rules.v4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To forward your traffic over ZeroTier you need to make sure that "Allow Global" is ticked in your ZeroTier client. This will let your traffic flow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also set your primary DNS to be the ZeroTier address of the Pihole so that your DNS queries are funneled via ZeroTier without the rest of your traffic, this can be useful when using less hostile networks that you still want adblocking enabled.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 23:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2020-05-16:/2020/05/vpn-using-zerotier-and-a-raspberry-pi/</guid><category>How To</category><category>Projects</category><category>Networking</category></item><item><title>Level 8 - Switch Online &amp; Tactical Fantasies</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2020/05/level-8-switch-online-tactical-fantasies/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week the outline for this post was built by my InfluxDB powered twitter bot and automatically saved into Notion! Handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Final Fantasy Tactics A2 (DS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*5h45m this week, 11h32m total*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to tackle my backlog during the lockdown, I had a look through my DS games and decided to give Final Fantasy Tactics A2 another go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the pinnacles of turn based games in my opinion. The battles are 15-20 minutes long and always feel fair. The law system seems to add some challenge but I’m not sure if the restrictions are randomised or not; time will tell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll definitely be playing this some more over the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Switch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*1h45m this week, 52h15m total*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m burning out on New Horizons. It’s awesome, and I enjoyed the time I spent on my island immensely but... it’s lacking something....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss going to the island with my wife. We spent countless evenings back at uni going on island tours. I hope they bring that back. The random islands are crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to my villagers, watering flowers, and tending to fruit trees has lost its shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Super Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Swi… (Switch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*0h45m this week, 15h50m total*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week one of my friends finally got Nintendo Switch online, so we had some fun with the SNES version of Mario Kart, and found out just how bad we are in Super Mario World. More practice required!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 18:08:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2020-05-11:/2020/05/level-8-switch-online-tactical-fantasies/</guid><category>gaming</category></item><item><title>Level 7 - April 2020 Gaming</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2020/05/level-7-april-2020-gaming/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The world is in a weird place right now. We're mostly confined to our homes, and spend pretty much all of our time at home. Well, that's perfect for some backlog bashing! Here is the rundown of games I played during April - coronavirus month 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Nintendo Switch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Platform:** Nintendo Switch **Playtime**: 28h10m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="image-caption"&gt;![Animal Crossing: New Horizons](/images/2024/02/b3315-e417f50877.png){:class="img-fluid" :alt="Animal Crossing New Horizons"}&lt;br&gt;
*Animal Crossing New Horizons*&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprises for my most played game in April... We've been waiting for this for years, and it launched at possibly the perfect time. Everyone wants an escape from coronavirus, and what a great place to hunker down to than your very own deserted island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect this game to dominate for the next few months whilst I continue to play every day. I'm currently redesigning my island and moving all my villagers around to make them neat and tidy community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flower breeding, and terraforming take up most of my time now. Plus the addition of watering my wife's hybrid flowers ever night means this is definitely a game to play every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely my game of the year so far!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Dragon Quest XI S (Nintendo Switch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Platform:** Nintendo Switch **Playtime:** 6h05m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got Dragon Quest XI for Christmas and played for roughly 40 hours before I got stuck at a boss and didn't go back. I needed a break from island life in April so I spent about an hour grinding some levels and managed to smack down the boss that was standing in my way (Alizarin, if you're interested)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="image-caption"&gt;![](/images/2024/02/15be3-1efe5383d7.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;br&gt;
*Dragon Quest XI S Title Screen*&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story resumed, and I got sucked straight back into the wonderful JRPG world. I think I'm a boss or two away from the end of Act 2 so I'll try and finish this soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll need to go back and finish Act 3 and the retro Tickington Quests at some point too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## 42 All-Time Classics (Nintendo DS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Platform:** Nintendo DS **Playtime:** 5h48m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="image-caption"&gt;![](/images/2024/02/5396b-28c228244d.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;br&gt;
*42 All-Time Classics Box Art*&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had this Nintendo DS game for literally ages. I remember playing it back at college with friends, and how much fun it was. This time around, I set out to complete stamp mode (on easy, because I don't care what you think) and managed that over the course of a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CPU definitely cheated when I was playing backgammon, and I hate to think what that would have been like on a harder mode. Nah, that's no fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a sequel arriving on Nintendo Switch in June (51 Worldwide Games!) and am super excited for it. It looks like it will have online multiplayer, which is great since I don't live near any of my switch owning friends. That is definitely gonna be a Day 1 purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## OpenTTD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Platform:** PC **Playtime:** 4h55m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="image-caption"&gt;[![OpenTTD Game Screenshot](/images/2024/02/fb7be-1ac14ad236.png){:class="img-fluid"}](/images/2024/02/fb7be-1ac14ad236.png)&lt;br&gt;
*One of my stations*&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic. I must have played this for literally hundreds of hours over the years and it never gets old. This time around I downloaded some UK trainsets and new industries. Uranium Mine &amp;gt; Power Station &amp;gt; Nuclear Waste is a neat industry tree that is more fun to build than the usual Coal&amp;gt;Power Station because it is a bit more detailed. The UK trains are just a joy to see travelling around my miniature train networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![](/images/2024/02/dd972-ce26367e04.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might not play again for a few months or even years, but I will always come back to TTD!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Platform:** PC **Playtime:** 1h23m&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to say about this yet. I finished a handful of missions, and drove around the map quite a lot. This has been in my backlog literally forever, so hopefully I can get motivated to finish it soon. Short pick up and play style + a drug dealing mini game in the style of the classic Drug Wars, what is not to like here? I think it was one of the few 'Mature' rated games for the Nintendo DS!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 11:28:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2020-05-02:/2020/05/level-7-april-2020-gaming/</guid><category>gaming</category></item><item><title>InfluxDB to Exist.io - Logging Gaming Time</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2020/04/influxdb-to-exist-io-logging-gaming-time/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Getting as much data into Exist as I can is important to me. So far this year I've built integrations for...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Gaming Time&lt;br&gt;
- [Pages Read](https://www.jamesleighton.com/2020/01/15/Logging-pages-read-to-Exist-io-via-Shortcuts-app/) (via iOS Shortcuts)&lt;br&gt;
- Money Spent (using the Monzo API)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post details how I am tracking gaming time. I found a method around Christmas 2019 that lets you retrieve accurate playtime from your Nintendo Switch via the parental controls app/feature. This was cool, but I don't always play things on my Switch, so we had to go deeper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking that a bit further, I discovered a [project on Github](https://github.com/c99koder/personal-influxdb) that tracked all of this data (and more!) into '[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)'. InfluxDB is a 'time series' database, and as such is really good at storing data like the amount of time you played in a day, the temperature of your living room, or the level of sunlight your house receives at intervals throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can then visualise this data with ease in ‘[Grafana](https://grafana.com/)’ - I played around with the gaming dashboard available from the [previously mentioned project](https://github.com/c99koder/personal-influxdb), and tailored it for the data I want to see. For example, I don't care about achievements so they got removed from the dashboard layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Grafana Gaming Time Dashboard](/images/2024/02/61d94-090ae32166.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To take this a step further, I wrote a small python script that retrieves playtime for a given day and submits it to [Exist.io](http://exist.io). This let's it become a part of the trend and correlation engine that powers the Exist dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Script Output](/images/2024/02/a9864-6631d00e7e.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Exist Media Dashboard](/images/2024/02/b3bbc-304fafa5d4.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Exist Gaming Day of week averages](/images/2024/02/00df3-e28e134bb7.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My python code can be found [https://github.com/jleighton/influx_gaming_to_exist](https://github.com/jleighton/influx_gaming_to_exist). I have this code submitting to exist.io every hour on a cronjob. The code that retrieves Switch playtime runs every 4 hours during the day, Steam and Rescuetime run hourly (just before the Exist push happens)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that whether I play something on Steam, other PC games like OpenTTD, or my Nintendo Switch all the playtime gets captured and logged without a second thought. It just works, and that’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised that I then needed someway of logging playtime on systems that can't automatically post their data; such as my trusty 3DS, Snes Classic, and any games I play on my phone or tablet. This is a topic for another post, but what I did was build a small python based web interface (Flask based) to log playtime. Sneak peak below...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Web form to submit Nintendo 3DS Playtime](/images/2024/02/1a35a-fd1a8c8ed8.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 11:28:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2020-04-12:/2020/04/influxdb-to-exist-io-logging-gaming-time/</guid><category>exist.io, howto, projects</category></item><item><title>Logging pages read to Exist.io via Shortcuts</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2020/01/logging-pages-read-to-exist-io-via-shortcuts/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was messing around with the [Exist.IO](http://exist.IO) API over the weekend to see what I could build. I noticed that there was a 'Pages read' attribute that I could post to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect! I then wondered how easily I could build an iOS app that would let me submit that each day (Spoiler: quite a lot of work) however, I remembered that Shortcuts was a thing and decided to see if it was possible to use a shortcut to post to an API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes - I have a home screen icon that asks me how many pages I've read and sends it to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Shortcut App - Prompt to enter pages read](/images/2024/02/d9b1e-7c53185a14.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Successful Log to Exist.io](/images/2024/02/06713-abe636a216.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started with this, you should head over to the [Exist.IO developer pages](http://developer.exist.io/) and have a read through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Create a developer client from your account settings within Exist, and make sure it has access to the pages_read attribute. This will give you the information you require to generate the access tokens needed for the Shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2024/02/86a3f-b21584c1fd.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The follow the OAuth2 authentication steps, and create your access token. (I have some Python code that will help do this, but I need to tidy it up before I release it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, You can load the following shortcut on your phone or ipad and paste in your authentication token and that is it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Top Three Games Every Month So far in 2019 (by time played) ###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't say how long I played each for, since the Parental control app doesn't say with any accuracy but also because they aren't for very long!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;### Games Completed in 2019: ###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't really completed much this year. I've not had the focus to really knuckle down on my longer games, and most of my shorter games aren't the sort that you can 'complete' in any meaningful way. Hopefully I should get some more time soon whilst I am travelling to really sink my teeth into some of my Switch backlog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Mario Bros. (Switch)&lt;br&gt;
2. Rune Factory 4 (3DS)&lt;br&gt;
3. Captain Toad Treasure Tracker (Switch)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### Games I am playing now &amp;amp; next ###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got Mario Maker 2 yesterday, which I think will become my new 'go-to game' when I don't want to play anything else. This title currently belongs to POWGI Wordsearch which is just relaxing and helps me de-stress. I picked up Terraria on switch recently too, but I haven't been able to get to grips with the controls. Maybe if I spend some more with it they'll 'click'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next on my backlist to complete includes Wargroove, South Park Stick of Truth, and eventually getting through Skyrim AND Breath of The Wild. I really need to complete 2 or 3 games before September when Dragon Quest XI comes out!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2019 11:28:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2019-07-07:/2019/07/level-5-what-ive-been-playing-in-2019/</guid><category>gaming</category></item><item><title>Essential road-warrior travel technology for geeks</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2019/06/essential-road-warrior-travel-technology-for-geeks/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I have spent a lot of time travelling for work during the first half of 2019, and am starting to perfect the perfect grab bag of technology to make my work and leisure time out of the office more useful, productive and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to judge what you'll be doing, where you are going, and how much spare time you'll have. Don't bring a 3DS and a Switch if you are going for three days and know you'll be out every night. Consider wether you really need your laptop AND your iPad - the iPad always loses. Every gram counts when you're on the move, so make it count and consolidate as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***USB C Multi Charger (Macbook Pro Compatible) + Another USB Charger***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cut down on the number of cables, and adapters you need; you should look at buying a USB C charger for your laptop (if your laptop charges via USB-C) that also has USB A ports. I bought an 'Engergea' adapter at Duty Free in Singpore earlier this year, and it works great for my 2017 Macbook Pro. It also supports QC3 so can fast charge my phone. This product isn't available in the UK, but there is a product which is identical except for the brand available [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Satechi-Charger-Qualcomm-compatible-MacBook/dp/B07D83RWDM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=usb+c+power+delivery+macbook+quick+charge&amp;amp;qid=1560446469&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-21&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=geekyjames-21&amp;amp;linkId=1ad88f1927f7094a00519b35079a9433&amp;amp;language=en_GB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have an Anker 5 port USB charger that I carry, so that I can leave one permantanly in the hotel room whilst the other can come to the office with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**International Power Adapters / Leads**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel Adapters suck. If you can, get a figure 8 cable for the above charger that has the local plug for your destination as well as one or two relevant travel adapters. This will save you pain later when one inevitably fails on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double check the voltage of your equipment against your destination so you don't accidentally fry anything. Generally most usb chargers will be 110/230V compatible, and [this site](https://www.power-plugs-sockets.com/) can help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Travel Router - Gl iNet Mobile Router**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This [tiny USB powered travel router](https://amzn.to/2O0zpFo) runs OpenWRT and lets you create your own secure Wifi hotspot. Simply connect it to the wifi at your remote office, or hotel and then your devices connect to it. No more spending ages reconfiguring wifi every time you move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also create an openVPN tunnel that works great with [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/), but I would recommend buying a faster router with more resources if you plan on using the tunnel a lot whilst streaming or gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked fantastic on hotel wifi when combined with a Chromecast on my last trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[![Gl Inet Mobile Router](/images/2024/02/44b7f-f9278728d4.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}](https://amzn.to/2O0zpFo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[![Ethernet, Wifi Repeater, USB Modem, Mobile Tethering](/images/2024/02/63efe-aa0961b739.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}](https://amzn.to/2O0zpFo)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Google Chromecast**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Chromecast](https://store.google.com/gb/product/chromecast) is normally a bad idea when travelling and using public wifi. By design, anyone on your network can control your stream and fuck with you by pausing your stream and changing the volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[![Google Chromecast](/images/2024/02/fb240-783254f158.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}](https://store.google.com/gb/product/chromecast)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromecast plus a [portable travel router](https://amzn.to/2O0zpFo) is a much better idea. Easily stream Netflix, Youtube etc with minimal fuss. I need to test Netflix using a non-public VPN to see if that works; but all the major VPN providers are blocked by netflix now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Nintendo Switch + Portable Dock**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Nintendo Switch](/images/2024/02/e6188-89d8c85cdf.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No better way of wasting some down time than video games, and there is no better way to play games when your travelling than the [Nintendo Switch](https://amzn.to/2JKjupq). The switch has a nice variety of 'proper' console quality games + niche indie games. Combined with a portable travel dock (using the electrical guts from a spare dock) it makes a great addition to your trip. Portable mode for playing in the pub, docked mode back at your room or in the meeting room. Maybe...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for third party docks, and chargers as they can cause problems with charging the switch leading to potential bricks. I 3D printed a case for a spare dock from my wife's switch that she never uses and bring along an official switch power adapter so it is effectively using a 'real switch dock' without any of the bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Bose Soundtouch Micro**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a [Bose Soundtouch Micro](https://amzn.to/2XPxlo4) recently on a trip to the Middle East as I wanted better sound than my macbook or phone could give. I don't have it too loud (because I am not an arsehole) but it gives very nice sound at reasonable volume for any hotel room or aparthotel sized space. It also sounds great for podcasts. Be warned that whilst it has a microphone, I can't get this to work for Skype or Whatsapp calls on Android Pie (Samsung Galaxy Note 8) which is annoying. Also, bear in mind this speaker is bluetooth only and has no auxillary input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[![Bose Soundtouch Micro](/images/2024/02/c2b5c-c1a425d870.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}](https://amzn.to/2XPxlo4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Video Adapters + Cables**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you embrace the USB C life (see above point about laptop chargers), you will never have enough dongles. I have two USB-C to HDMI cables, plus a HDMI coupler (a few quid on eBay) in case you need to connect to a HDMI lead trailing from the projector or TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have a USB-C to VGA adapter too in case you end up in meeting rooms from the past. It happens. A lot. Or buy a laptop with actually useful connections. Everyone will laugh at you every time you need to use a dongle to connect to something. They're just jealous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus you'll need a standard HDMI cable for your Switch dock too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![USB C to HDMI Cable](/images/2024/02/c4c5c-e0e94a9b1e.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Cable Organisation**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be taking a ton of chargers, video leads, dongles and more with you. Invest in some oversized pencil cases to keep your crap tidy. I use one for my laptop charging gear, and another for everything else. Mostly this means I do not end up with a giant spaghetti mess of cables at my destination!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2019 19:42:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2019-06-13:/2019/06/essential-road-warrior-travel-technology-for-geeks/</guid><category>review</category></item><item><title>Tracking planes from your laptop (ADS-B)</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2019/03/tracking-planes-from-your-laptop-ads-b/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My [local hackspace](https://maidstone-hackspace.org.uk/) recently acquired [SDR dongle](https://amzn.to/2F9eXu5) for us to use, and since I've been wanting to have a play around with Software Defined Radios I spent an evening learning how to use it. Here is my quick rundown of how to track ADS-B plane transmissions using Mac OSX 10.14 and displaying them on a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![The SDR dongle and assorted bits](/images/2024/02/f1807-60be9fd876.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some background on software defined radios, the idea is that the radio's characteristics can be changed on the fly by software so you can receive all sorts of different types of transmissions across the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common chip (RTL2832) used in USB Digital TV (DVB-T) tuners could be used as an effective software defined radio, so more people became interested. More information can be [found here](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/about-rtl-sdr/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_dependent_surveillance_%E2%80%93_broadcast) is a system used by commercial flights to relay position, and speed information to the ground. It is the basis of sites such as FlightRadar24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried a few different versions of dump-1090; the earlier ones used the Google Maps API which is no longer free and doesn't work without a google dev account. Eventually I settled on dump1090-mutability which uses OSM (OpenStreetMap tiles) and worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found instructions from [here](https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2017/01/Monitoring-aircraft-via-ADS-B-on-OS-X.html) which worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using nginx, I simply used python's [SimpleHTTPServer](https://lifehacker.com/start-a-simple-web-server-from-any-directory-on-your-ma-496425450) because I use it all the time and it saved installing yet another program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Flights shown on the map](/images/2024/02/c7a08-2eff32945e.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We managed to pick up on flights over 40 miles away! An idea for the 'future projects' list is to get this setup again with the proper antennas designed for 1090mhz transmissions. More research required...&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 10:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2019-03-16:/2019/03/tracking-planes-from-your-laptop-ads-b/</guid><category>projects</category></item><item><title>Bootstrap 4 - New Blog Theme</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2019/01/bootstrap-4-new-blog-theme/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I decided last week that I really wanted a card based theme for my blog. After all, [cards are cool](https://www.intercom.com/blog/why-cards-are-the-future-of-the-web/).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending a few hours messing around with existing themes, and trying to customise them to my vision for what I wanted... someone at my local hackspace suggested I took a look at Bootstrap when I couldn't get them to generate valid HTML properly. This was cool because I got to learn something new (see [2019 goals](/2018/12/29/2019-goals/)!) but because Bootstrap is modern and responsive and made creating the cards I longed for super duper simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a HTML/CSS/JS framework for building modern websites and applications, and I initially felt like the task was going to be enormous and promptly gave up when I couldn't get anything to work right away. It turned out with not very much effort I was able to make a pretty decent looking blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Bootstrap 4](/images/2024/02/19941-2cce9a940a.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I reconsidered my efforts and set about building the blog from the ground up, and then implementing it into my new Jekyll theme after I had something that looked nice. This turned out to be a 'good idea'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few more hours later, I had the framework for how I envisaged the blog to look. We had the cards for blog posts on the home page, no pagination - because pagination annoys me - and a working navigation bar. I just needed to work on the post layout (the page you are reading now) and it turns out someone had done the hard work. I found [this template](https://github.com/blackrockdigital/startbootstrap-blog-post/) blog post available under an MIT licence ready to drop into Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning my HTML template into a Jekyll theme was pretty site, and you can see how I did it by looking at the [Github repository](https://github.com/jleighton/jleighton.github.io) for this blog. I am planning to write a long form how-to guide for this but that will take a while. Pretty much you need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Split the layout into it's most basic form. Header, blog layout, sidebar, navbar, etc etc. Whatever makes the most sense.&lt;br&gt;
* Add the header code to a file in the ```_includes``` folder, add the navbar code to another file, add the jumbotron code to yet another file, the footer code etc. You get the idea. You basically need to split out the theme so Jekyll knows what to include and where&lt;br&gt;
* Create layout templates that live in ```_layouts```. These include your post template, the default home page, a blank page that just has the Bootstrap scaffolding (see [Travel Map](/uk-travel-map) page). These layout templates will reference the files in ```_includes```.&lt;br&gt;
* These templates are reference in your markdown content so Jekyll can render your content how you want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of having the layout logic separated as much as possible into discrete files is that it makes updating your sidebar or the way you want the post cards to display super easy and less error prone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[This post](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/) from the official Jekyll site gives a good run down of how this process of theme creation works, and is worth the read. Before you start, I would definitely try to have a full understanding of how Jekyll works under the hood plus a decent working knowledge of HTML &amp;amp; CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To theme my blog I used [Bootswatch United](https://bootswatch.com/united/) which is a theme for Bootstrap. Long time readers much recognise the colour; my old Pelican blog used the same theme! Using Bootstrap themes is as simple as adding the CSS link to your header. There are loads of different themes available but I just love orange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Optional theme --&gt;

&lt;!-- End Optional theme --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pretty happy with the blog as it stands, but there are always things to improve. I am still looking a decent commenting solution that isn't Disqus and doesn't require my commenters to have Gitub accounts. As always, if you have any suggestions please drop me a tweet! @geekyjames&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### Features&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Card layouts for all blog posts based from one card template.&lt;br&gt;
- Easy to generate a page for a specific category or tags.&lt;br&gt;
- Home page is the about page, rather than the wall of blog posts.&lt;br&gt;
- Fully responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile&lt;br&gt;
- Orange!&lt;/p&gt;

Most of these involve self improvement of some sort, and crucially don't involve simply cutting things out, or a fixed number of things to do a week or whatever.. Each year I've said 'exercise 3 times a week', 'no energy drinks'.... Well that doesn't end up happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 was a great year, and 2019 will be even better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Goals for 2019](/images/2024/02/be32f-7c3823751f.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Spend time improving yourself mentally and physically&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Lose 3.8 stone (24kg) by the time you're thirty (413 days and counting!)&lt;br&gt;
- Become proficient in Python coding&lt;br&gt;
- Dabble some more with Pi/Arduino stuff&lt;br&gt;
- Complete certifications such as project management through work&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Enjoy what you have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Play the games you already own. You can have 2 'joker' games throughout the year though because you're going to buy them anyway...&lt;br&gt;
- Read the books on your (virtual) shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Cook more, drink less, be healthier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Learn to cook from Amelia (my wife)&lt;br&gt;
- Drink less alcohol, less coffee, less energy drinks&lt;br&gt;
- Drink more water&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2018-12-29:/2018/12/2019-goals/</guid><category>health, life</category></item><item><title>Migrating Pelican blog posts to Jekyll</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2018/10/migrating-pelican-blog-posts-to-jekyll/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Pelican and Jekyll both use markdown formatting for their posts, but their post metadata (front matter in Jekyll parlance) formatting is slightly different. I have over 150 posts to migrate, so started looking for a few ways to make this process easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll metadata needs to be surrounded by two lines containing three dashes `---`. This is easily achieved with the use of [sed](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-text-in-files-in-linux-unix-shell/). To add the line to very top of the file, use the following [sed command](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/269758).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```shell&lt;br&gt;
sed -i '1i ---' *.md&lt;br&gt;
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add the line directly underneath your front matter, you can use something like this which looks for a line that contains 'Status:' then adds a new line with '---' underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked for me as all my metadata finished up with 'Status: Published' but you may need to adjust this as nessecary for your files. Alternatively if your front matter is the same number of lines in every file, you could adjust the sed command from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```shell&lt;br&gt;
sed -i 's/.*Status:.*/&amp;amp;\n---/' *.md&lt;br&gt;
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap 'Category:'' for 'categories:' in the metadata. I'm not sure why I had to do this, but my post categories started working when I used 'categories' and not category so I used sed to swap them over as below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```shell&lt;br&gt;
sed -i 's/Category:/categories:/g' *.md&lt;br&gt;
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will also need to remove commas from any tag listing you have. I haven't figured out how to do this programatically but it didn't take too long to do manually. Open all your posts in your favourite text editor and update them all. I also took this as a chance to tidy up and consolidate the categories on each post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```shell&lt;br&gt;
nano *.md&lt;br&gt;
```&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step is to rename each post as per 'YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.md'. My bash skills are rusty, so I whilst I am sure this is possible within a script I felt it would take me longer to learn how to do this than doing it manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the following command to save the top of every file into a text file. This made it super simple to rename each file and not miss any when working through the files manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone knows a simpler method, please leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;```shell&lt;br&gt;
head -n 10 *.md &amp;gt; front.txt&lt;br&gt;

The annual renewal was coming around quickly and $100 was not going to fly this year so I started to look at [Static Site Generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having previously used Pelican before, I knew how good they could be but also what a pain they could make out of the blogging workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican required me to run its scripts to generate the site, and I still had to find somewhere to host the static HTML files. Not a big deal granted, but it meant having to SSH into a VPS whenever I wanted to change something. It meant saving $100 per year which was totally worth the trade offs for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the move back to [Pelican](https://www.staticgen.com/pelican) again last month, but came across several issues with my converted Markdown posts and began to search for an alternative as Pelican was choking on the files without indicating which files were causing the problem. [Jekyll](https://www.staticgen.com/jekyll) is that alternative which is powering the site you are reading now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host now and fundamentally that means I write my post in markdown using whatever editing I want, commit it to the master branch of my repository and Github will then generate and publish my pages for me. It's also completely free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Publishing a blog post with Github Pages](/images/2024/02/ffe03-5324568aab.png)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing to host, nothing to maintain, nothing to worry about. I can blog from my phone, my chromebook, or the github web interface if it really came to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) base, but moved onto the [Poole/Hyde theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com/). I've spent the last week customising the theme to my liking. So far I've added the following items with more planned for the future. If you want to see how any of this has been done, then check out my github repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Font Awesome icons for metadata and social links&lt;br&gt;
- Post image tags that show up on index (and soon archive) pages. These can be set per post, otherwise they will default to a category level image&lt;br&gt;
- OG Graph tags for prettier sharing on Twitter and Facebook&lt;br&gt;
- A scrollable version of my travel map&lt;br&gt;
- Fix /archives/ - this is currently rendering particularly badly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am super happy with the results, and now it's just the SUPER FUN task of migrating over one hundred more posts as I get the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2018 22:58:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2018-09-22:/2018/09/my-new-jekyll-powered-blog/</guid><category>projects</category></item><item><title>An update to how I use Exist.io (Android Edition)</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2018/09/an-update-to-how-i-use-exist-io-android-edition/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Twelve months ago I wrote a&lt;a href="https://medium.com/geekyjames/life-tracking-with-exist-8b3339c548c7" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; blog post&lt;/a&gt; that explained how I used &lt;a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=jamesleighton" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Exist.io&lt;/a&gt; with all the various services and hardware that I owned. That was iPhone centric, but I now use a Galaxy Note 8 so there has been some fairly major changes to my workflow. Read on…!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2018/09/50309-1yconuowomqi38wirfgylnw.png" class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" alt="Exist.io" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=jamesleighton" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Exist.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest change was obviously changing from iOS to Android. The Exist app on android is just as great as the iPhone version so this was no big deal. The big deal is in Android wearables. Android Wear is dire. I bought a Huawei Sport 2, and fairly rapidly replaced it with a Fitbit Charge 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2018/09/fbae0-1tsaxprxpipkdl3i2cyzs9a.jpeg" class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep tracking on the Huawei was terrible, Google Fit is a special piece of rubbish, and nothing ever synced properly as the watch tried it’s best to push me into their own Huawei Health system. No thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually decided to try Fitbit. Their app is great, the tracker is fantastic (maybe another post on that some other time) and it just works all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wear it 24/7 except for swimming (battery life is 4–5 days) and it feeds the following data into Exist. The fact it works all day and all night means that Exist gets quite a lot of tasty data to analyse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="b2fd"&gt;Time Asleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="407f"&gt;Time in Bed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="48aa"&gt;Steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="8c8c"&gt;Continuous Heart Rate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span id="7e7d"&gt;Workouts Logged&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started swimming at my local pool and was wondering how I would log this into Fitbit (without buying a new swim-proof fitbit…). Turns out the pool uses a service called &lt;a href="http://www.seeyourswim.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Swimtag&lt;/a&gt;. You make an account with them, check out a wristband and go swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you return the band, your swim data is analysed and uploads to your account. This gives you lots of interesting stats, but most importantly it can post your swims into Fitbit. Perfect! It even supports challenges, but sadly doesn’t have badges…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started dabbling with meditation at the end of the day to help me wind down for sleep. Exist can store ‘time meditating’ but only reads this from Google Fit. Hmm… I found an app for this, ‘&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.telesoftas.meditationtimer" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Meditation Timer &amp;amp; Log&lt;/a&gt;’ which is available free from Google Play. Just go into settings and connect Google Fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things I want to do in the future is looking at building my own integrations for Untapped (to record beers in Exist) and Monzo (to log daily spending). I think both of these data points would be interesting and could have some curious correlations to sleep, mood and others. These are on my list of things to do when I eventually get around to delving back into Python coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to try &lt;a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=jamesleighton" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Exist,&lt;/a&gt; please use &lt;a href="https://exist.io/?referred_by=jamesleighton" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;my link&lt;/a&gt; to get two months free (and $2 off my next bill!)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:07:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2018-09-12:/2018/09/an-update-to-how-i-use-exist-io-android-edition/</guid><category>android, How To, Real world</category></item><item><title>Swim not gym!</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2018/09/swim-not-gym/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I tried the gym. I hate the gym. I keep trying, but it’s always awful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I joined the local leisure centre. This is better. The pool brings back nostalgia from my childhood. I used to be a pretty decent swimmer when I was&lt;br&gt;
a kid. Not so much anymore, but it’s a nice memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Swimming Pool](/images/2024/02/ff9a6-61d4f57727.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time my wife and I went swimming sucked. I managed ten 25 metre lengths. We went again the next day and I managed an extra two lengths. But I was&lt;br&gt;
enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suck at breathing and swimming (a potentially deadly combination!) but on the third visit I managed 22 lengths! I’m feeling motivated to continue and I think&lt;br&gt;
I can feel the benefits already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll let you know how I’m feeling after the first month. I think we’ll stick with it this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Sep 2018 19:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2018-09-03:/2018/09/swim-not-gym/</guid><category>health</category></item><item><title>What I've been playing - Level 3</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2018/06/what-ive-been-playing-level-3/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Since February I played mostly games on my Switch...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/oxenfree"&gt;Oxenfree&lt;/a&gt;. It's a short 5 hour point and click adventure, highly recommend it. The story was amazing, don't go looking for spoilers! If you haven't played it, go and play it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/977676271361642496&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started playing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/970765422726451200"&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/a&gt; (again, didn't finish) . Maybe I'll try again later in the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/970765422726451200&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost finished &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/962066024894836738"&gt;Mario+Rabbids&lt;/a&gt;. Need to go back and finish that off at some point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/962066024894836738&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got stuck into &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/984897874017206272"&gt;Football Manager Nintendo Switch Edition&lt;/a&gt; taking Bangor City to the top of the Welsh Premier League three years in a row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/984897874017206272&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play a little bit of &lt;a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/nplusplus"&gt;N++&lt;/a&gt; every day. There's 4000 levels, it's gonna take a while. 4 hours, 0.048% complete, 1029 deaths... yeah the tweet has a typo. oh well! I quite like how bite sized it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/1005472618168774656&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played quite a lot of Powgi Wordsearch with Milly. This is a surprisingly fun co-op game. Who knew how angry you get when someone finds the word you've set your heart on finding....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2018/06/h2x1_nswitchds_wordsearchbypowgi_image1600w.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1267" width="1600" height="800" alt="h2x1_nswitchds_wordsearchbypowgi_image1600w" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Played a bit of Rocket League but didn't get into it fully. Maybe with the next update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/984492864993353728&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried to get into Pokemon Ultra Moon. Shit, that's a slow game. Let's hope that the new Switch pokemon games aren't this slow. I think I got to the second island before becoming bored out of my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently deep into Disgaea 5. I think I'm a healthy way into the story, but I keep distracting myself with the Item World. It's pretty much one of my favourite games ever. Between that, and N++ I've not been playing much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/1005470227478470656&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Hitlist for the next few months. Pretty heavily 3DS biased, because it's gathering dust and I have a ton of 3DS stuff I've not got to yet! Expect the next gaming update in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dragon Quest Builders (NS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retro City Rampage (NS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy (3DS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zelda Picross (3DS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pullblox (3DS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario Tennis Open (3DS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luigi's Mansion 2 (3DS)&lt;/li&gt;

I'm on track with my diet (mostly), I'm trying to cut back on sugars and (especially) sweeteners, so why not do something that stretches my brains in the evenings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2018/06/python-logo-master-v3-tm-flattened.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1254" width="601" height="203" alt="python-logo-master-v3-tm-flattened" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have enough games in my backlog that I could probably play every game to completion and still not beat them all before I retire so that's kind of low priority, I just need to stop buying new fucking games. Hmm. Looking at you, Lumines Remastered. And N++. And Smash Bros.  And the stupid fucking Snes Mini sat on my desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was pretty nifty with Python about ten years ago so why not jump back in. I vaguely remember working on an IRC bot for the channel I used to mod back in the day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this list of &lt;a href="https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/"&gt;mini projects&lt;/a&gt; which I am going to work through and blog about as I get through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dice Rolling Sim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guess the Number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mad Libs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text Adventure Game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hangman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent an evening this week setting up a Linux virtual machine to keep my environment consistent no matter what computer I am using (VirtualBox + Ubuntu 18.04) and revived my old BitBucket account (because I like the ability to set a repository to private) then spent an evening learning Git whilst cobbling together two versions of the dice sim. I'll make a separate post about that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

I already use &lt;a href="http://jamesleighton.com/2017/08/05/life-tracking-with-exist-io/"&gt;Rescuetime with Exist&lt;/a&gt; as a measure of sleep, productivity, social media posts, and other things that correlate to these like the weather, the length of the day, and more. It's pretty neat and I look at it several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One metric it misses is driving time. As someone who drove 17,000 miles in the last 12 months for work this is pretty key to me. Apparently &lt;a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/new-integration-with-automatic-track-your-driving-time-like-your-computer-time/"&gt;rescuetime can do it with an expensive add on,&lt;/a&gt; but that only works in the US so that's no good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a look through the rest of the Exist integrations and nothing really supports what I want. So, I've found another way of recording this information directly. Sadly it won't be with the rest of my Exist data but aTimeLogger generates its own fancy graphs and allows me to export the data to standard formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2018/02/screenshot_smartselect_2018-02-12-13-45-24.jpg?w=1288" class="aligncenter wp-image-1243" width="397" height="631" alt="Screenshot of aTimeLogger" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Android Auto --&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;amp;hl=en_GB"&gt;Tasker&lt;/a&gt; --&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://www.atimelogger.com/"&gt;aTimeLogger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the flow is as follows. You could also automate this based on connecting to a certain bluetooth radio, or even just an NFC tag you have stuck to your dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plug my phone into my car with Android Auto.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Tasker sends an intent to aTimeLogger to start timing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disconnect from my car&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tasker notices the change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tasker sends another intent to aTimeLogger to stop timing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get this working, add your groupings to aTimeLogger. I added a top level grouping of transportation with train and driving inside this grouping. I guess I'll add flying to this at some point too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, go into Tasker and create two new tasks. One for when you plug your phone in, and one for when you disconnect.  The task below is for when you connect your phone, and is explained line by line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A1:&lt;/strong&gt; Wait for 3 seconds for the connection to stabilise and the radio in the car to sort itself out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A2:&lt;/strong&gt; Using the aTimeLogger plugin in tasker, stop the Driving task if running and start it again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A3:&lt;/strong&gt; Wait another 4 seconds, same reasoning as above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A4:&lt;/strong&gt; Announce over the speakers that tracking is working. This seems to be able to talk over radio just like Google Maps can so is good if you're not actively listening to Spotify or something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Start Tracking Driving (2)
    A1: Wait [ MS:0 Seconds:3 Minutes:0 Hours:0 Days:0 ] 
    A2: aTimeLogger [ Configuration:Stop running and start Driving Timeout (Seconds):0 ] 
    A3: Wait [ MS:0 Seconds:4 Minutes:0 Hours:0 Days:0 ] 
    A4: Say [ Text:I&amp;#39;m tracking your driving now Engine:Voice:default:default Stream:3 Pitch:5 Speed:5 Respect Audio Focus:On Network:Off Continue Task Immediately:Off ]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stop driving task is pretty much the same, but A2 is reversed so it's Stop driving. Pretty simple. Make sure you actually save your changes as I managed to close them without saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you need to create some profiles that trigger based on Android Auto being active or not. The best way I found to do this was checking the variable %UIMODE and seeing if it was set to 'car' or not. This is set by Android Auto so its a good indicator as to whether I am in the car or not! Maybe there's a better way but this works for me.  Let me know in the comments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2018/02/screenshot_20180212-140517.jpg" class="wp-image-1244 aligncenter" width="332" height="283" alt="Screenshot_20180212-140517" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Profile: Car Active (7)
    State: Variable Value  [ %UIMODE ~ car ]

Profile: Car Not Active (8)
    State: Variable Value  [ %UIMODE neq car ]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these profiles are then linked to the above tasks which we previously set up. Now next time you connect your phone to Android Auto it should start time tracking in aTimeLogger and announce over your speakers that it's doing so. As soon as you disconnect (I have to turn the ignition off, and open the drivers door before the phone fully disconnects) it will stop and save that time log. You shouldn't have to do anything further! Enjoy the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed in some of the screenshots that I am also doing something similar with sleep tracking. To do this, I am using &lt;a href="https://sleep.urbandroid.org/documentation/tutorials/tasker/"&gt;SleepAsAndroid&lt;/a&gt; alarm clock with its Android Wear add-on to actually track my sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasker is listening for the intents from SleepAsAndroid and starting the timer in aTimeLogger then stopping it for me in the morning when I stop my alarm.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2018-02-12:/2018/02/time-tracking-with-tasker/</guid><category>How To</category><category>android</category><category>android auto</category><category>automation</category><category>productivity</category><category>tasker</category><category>timetracking</category></item><item><title>What I've been playing - Level 2</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2018/02/what-ive-been-playing-level-2/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since my last blog post... I've been busy with work, the gym... and... playing lots of games! Here's a run down of that last activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After telling myself I wouldn't be buying Skyrim for the ~~second~~ third time, I bought Skyrim for the third time. I've spent the most time in the game this time, but I still got bored of the main quest. Pretty sure I finished the Dark Brotherhood questline, starting being a thieving shit in the Thieves Guild and generally romped my way across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing Skyrim on a portable is really neat, and probably the reason I managed to put so much time into it. I will go back and finish the main quest line at least, but for now I'm done with Skyrim again. I'm hoping for a Fallout port in the future so I can buy those again and play on the go. Please, Bethesda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geekyjames/status/959573682879266817" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2018/02/zzz1.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-1231 size-full" width="1200" height="675" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was deep into Stardew Valley too which continued into December. I've spent more time in Stardew Valley (60 hours) than any other Switch game in the last 11 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stardew is just the perfect zone out game after a long day. It's super duper easy to get sucked into 'one more day' too. For now I've stopped playing Stardew until the multiplayer is released later this year so I'm not entirely burned on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Not that kind of multiplayer....&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the top three for November was Super Mario Odyssey. I can't really say much that others haven't. It's such a good game and I need to go back and do it justice at some point. I got to the credits (not hard in any modern Mario) and haven't been back since. I might actually start a new save when I go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there was a Splatfest that I played in... I only really play Splatoon during Splatfests.... Nothing much else to say about December except that I got Mario + Rabbids for Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2018&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golf Story! Golf Story! Golf Story! What a great game!If you own a Nintendo Switch, and don't have Golf Story... what is wrong with you? It's an awesome mix of classic RPG with memorable dialogue mashed together with a decent golf game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2018/02/psx_20180203_005044.jpg" class="alignnone wp-image-1232 size-full" width="1280" height="720" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention it has ~~frisbee~~ disc golf, and mini golf alongside the normal golf you'd expect. I got about 15 hours of playtime out of it, and still CANNOT beat the last tournament. Holy crap, that was a difficulty spike and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I am playing now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently stuck into Mario + Rabbids battle kingdom which is seriously catering to my addiction to turn based strategy games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I am about a third of the way through so this will probably take up most of my February. Maybe I'll get into Farming Simulator next... I have a lot to choose from anyways...&lt;/p&gt;

I was going to avoid Super Mario Odyssey until I'd beaten Galaxy and Galaxy 2, but that didn't happen. (I got to the credits in Odyssey, though so that's OK. Maybe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think NOW would be a good time to STOP buying games, for the last time. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/11/2017110516171600-8aedff741e2d23fbed39474178692daf.jpg" class="wp-image-1193 aligncenter" width="480" height="270" alt="2017110516171600-8AEDFF741E2D23FBED39474178692DAF.jpg" /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/11/2017102800184600-8aedff741e2d23fbed39474178692daf.jpg" class="wp-image-1200 aligncenter" width="481" height="271" alt="2017102800184600-8AEDFF741E2D23FBED39474178692DAF.jpg" /&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/11/2017102722040200-8aedff741e2d23fbed39474178692daf.jpg" class="wp-image-1203 aligncenter" width="481" height="271" alt="2017102722040200-8AEDFF741E2D23FBED39474178692DAF.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The romp through the story of Odyssey was great, and I definitely agree with the majority of reviews. The game is brilliant! I think it'll now take its place as a 15 minute game whenever the urge strikes, complete some more mini games, go find some more power moons...  The photo mode is really good, btw...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/11/2017110516113600-ccfa659f4857f96dda29afedb2e166e6.jpg" class="wp-image-1190 aligncenter" width="481" height="270" alt="2017110516113600-CCFA659F4857F96DDA29AFEDB2E166E6.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odyssey's story took about 12 hours, over 3 gaming sessions. It pretty much consumed me last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Switch front, I also got myself heartily addicted to Stardew Valley in the last month. Welp, this game does 'one more day' perfectly. 25 hours later, and I am just about to start Year 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/11/2017110516140800-c2b49a475df5a340494292a1bd398579.jpg" class="wp-image-1197 aligncenter" width="481" height="270" alt="2017110516140800-C2B49A475DF5A340494292A1BD398579.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really need to play some of my 'other' switch games such as Disgaea 5, and I am Setsuna... but I think November might be the month of short 3DS games from my backlog. I am pretty close to beating (the first half, anyway) of Pokemon Silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I won't take the Switch with me on my travels this month....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current 'to play list'...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stardew Valley (Switch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokemon Silver (3DS Virtual Console)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pullblox (3DS Download)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Super Mario Galaxy (Wii)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last.fm now natively supports scrobbling from Spotify Connect. The Listenz service has now been discontinue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable this, head to your Last.fm account settings and open the Applications tab. Connect to Spotify here (Spotify Scrobbling) and you'll be good to Scrobble from Android Auto, Bose Soundtouch, PS4 and other Spotify connect applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/08/screen-shot-2018-06-09-at-15-21-05.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1263" width="1804" height="1332" alt="Screen Shot 2018-06-09 at 15.21.05" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rest of this post is left as an archive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty much impossible to scrobble songs you listen to via Spotify Connect via the standard spotify apps. However, recently Spotify released an updated API that allows the retrieval of the currently playing track. Some kind soul has therefore made the ~~'&lt;a href="https://spotifyscrobbler.com/"&gt;Spotify Scrobbler&lt;/a&gt;' ~~&lt;a href="https://liste.nz/"&gt;Listenz&lt;/a&gt; (they had to change the name to avoid the spotify trademark, apparently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://spotifyscrobbler.com/"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/08/2017-08-16-13_06_13-spotify-scrobbler-scrobbling-for-spotify-connect.png" class="wp-image-1154 aligncenter" width="516" height="483" alt="Spotify Scrobbler - Scrobbling for Spotify Connect" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means you can now track your plays from the PS4, and other devices that utilise Spotify Connect such as the Bose Soundtouch speaker range. Fantastic! It also means you can disable the unreliable scrobbling from each Spotify app you use as they break at least once a week for seemingly no reason. Super fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2017 12:23:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2017-08-16:/2017/08/how-to-scrobble-to-last-fm-with-spotify-connect/</guid><category>How To</category><category>lastfm</category><category>spotify</category></item><item><title>Removing Duplicate Scrobbles on Last.fm</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2017/08/removing-duplicate-scrobbles-on-last-fm/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, my last.fm account/spotify went mental last week and logged a single song 1000 times in a row. Since Last.fm is currently in the throes of dying and removing every last useful feature from their site, I was wondering how I could fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/sk22/39cc280840f9d82df574c15d6eda6629"&gt;sk22 on Github&lt;/a&gt; has provided a handy piece of javascript that works perfectly. Simply navigate to the page and enter the script into your address bar (or add it to a bookmark on the bookmark bar) and enjoy your duplicate free library!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've built up quite a collection of health and fitness apps over the last few years. MyFitnessPal (MFP) tracks my eating habits, Withings tracks my weight, my Apple Watch monitors my heart rate &amp;amp; my activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Life Tracking Flow](/images/2024/02/230a3-b97584ffc4.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that data! So many apps to view it all. Well, not really. Thanks to Apple Health and everything starting to talk to each other, all these disparate services can share their wealth of data with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the heart of my system is [Apple Health](https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/health/). I am sure if you are an Android user, then Google Health will probably do exactly the same job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, [MyFitnessPal](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/) logs my calorific intake and updates Apple Health every time I log anything. MyFitnessPal also updates my weight from Apple Health so it knows how far I am away from my goals, and can update my calorie predictions based on my actual weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is the [Apple Watch](http://amzn.to/2v9gTh3). I use this for Sleep Tracking (with the [Pillow app](https://neybox.com/pillow/)), Activity Tracking (both via passive tracking aka the [apple watch rings](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204517), and via the included Workouts app). The activity rings play a surprisingly massive role in my health and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They encourage you to do that little bit more, stand up that little bit longer, and take those extra few steps. You even get badges for completing streaks of days, weeks, and months, and it alerts all your friends with an Apple Watch every time you complete a ring! Everyone loves trophies, achievements and letting people know you are exercising, right? ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple Watch also passively monitors your heart rate all the time you are wearing it. All these data points feed directly into the Apple Health app without any intervention, making it super easy to track just how much or little you do in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[![Apple Watch Activity Tracking Overview](/images/2024/02/99014-f12e292301.png){:class="img-fluid"}](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204517)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final piece of hardware I have is an old set of [Withings wifi scales](http://amzn.to/2v8Zg0N).(Withings was bought by Nokia, so these are now branded as Nokia...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump on these in the morning (... after your morning ablutions..) and your weight will be updated in Apple Health. It will also be available to apps you've allowed to read this data like MyFitnessPal, and others. MFP will update its calorie predictions, as does the Activity tracking on the Apple Watch. If you stay standing on it long enough it will also do a heart rate reading and tell you the weather for the coming day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[![wifi-scale](/images/2024/02/28e88-3f8d3b874f.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}](http://amzn.to/2v9pPTH) [Nokia/Withings Smart Scales](http://amzn.to/2v9pPTH)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that really ties together all my data is a dashboard called [Exist](https://exist.io/?referred_by=jamesleighton). It connects to pretty much everything I care about... (Withings, RescueTime, DarkSky, Last.Fm, Google Calendar, Apple Health) and displays my data with averages, trends, and predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you sign up for a [trial of Exist with my link](https://exist.io/?referred_by=jamesleighton), you get an extra month for free (two months total!) so its worth checking out if you are at all interested in the data you generate every single day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see at a glance I walk about less on Saturdays, but I complete more workouts on Friday &amp;amp; Saturday. Basically, I sit at home most Saturdays, but I go to the gym more often then too. I can see via RescueTime I am more productive on Wednesdays and that Tuesdays are a shocker for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Screen Shot 2017-08-05 at 18.13.37.png](/images/2024/02/6eee9-0b813c924f.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sleep tracking I do my via Apple Watch feeds in, and shows me last night I slept for the longest I have in a month. I was obviously feeling lazy this morning! I can see my average bedtime of 11.25pm is 21 minutes earlier than normal and I've been waking up later. Maybe I could get up sooner and go to the damn gym instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will even work out ways to optimise for more steps, or active minutes etc. For example, when it doesn't 'rain or snow' my average steps go up by 19% or when my average heart rate is above 85bpm it goes up 54% (because I logged a workout!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![Screen Shot 2017-08-05 at 18.25.03.png](/images/2024/02/4739d-75986654d6.png){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some correlations are less useful... apparently I weigh less on days when its windier...? after I get fewer likes on Instagram...? Yup, the trick to weight loss is obvious now... post junk on Instagram on windy days! The longer Exist collects data, the more useful it gets. I really like seeing the randomness of things I do mapped out on a graph, suddenly everything isn't so random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, [Exist](https://exist.io/?referred_by=jamesleighton)is working really well for me. The cost is basically 2 pints a month (US\$6/month) but I am getting so much use out of my health data being visualised in such a decent way its been totally worth it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's helped me focus, and keeps me logging into MyFitnessPal every day. It focuses me on going for a walk, or just getting out of the house for a bit. All of these contribute more and more to my weight loss goals and just make me feel a happier person!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this massive essay was helpful to anyone looking at how to get the most out of their health &amp;amp; fitness data. I'd love to hear any comments on how other people manage this sort of stuff, so do please comment if you read this!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2017 17:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2017-08-05:/2017/08/life-tracking-with-exist/</guid><category>exist.io, health, howto</category></item><item><title>Life Tracking with Exist</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2017/08/life-tracking-with-exist-io/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I've built up quite a collection of health and fitness apps over the last few years. MyFitnessPal (MFP) tracks my eating habits, Withings tracks my weight, my Apple Watch monitors my heart rate &amp;amp; my activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2017/08/life-tracking-flow-2.png" class="alignnone" width="768" height="374" alt="Life Tracking App/Hardware/Services Flow Diagram" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Life Tracking App/Hardware/Services Flow Diagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that data! So many apps to view it all. Well, not really. Thanks to Apple Health and everything starting to talk to each other, all these disparate services can share their wealth of data with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the heart of my system is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/ios/health/"&gt;Apple Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I am sure if you are an Android user, then Google Health will probably do exactly the same job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/"&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; logs my calorific intake and updates Apple Health every time I log anything. MyFitnessPal also updates my weight from Apple Health so it knows how far I am away from my goals, and can update my calorie predictions based on my actual weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2v9gTh3"&gt;Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I use this for Sleep Tracking (with the &lt;a href="https://neybox.com/pillow/"&gt;Pillow app&lt;/a&gt;), Activity Tracking (both via passive tracking aka the &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204517"&gt;apple watch rings&lt;/a&gt;, and via the included Workouts app). The activity rings play a surprisingly massive role in my health and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They encourage you to do that little bit more, stand up that little bit longer, and take those extra few steps. You even get badges for completing streaks of days, weeks, and months, and it alerts all your friends with an Apple Watch every time you complete a ring! Everyone loves trophies, achievements and letting people know you are exercising, right?  ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple Watch also passively monitors your heart rate all the time you are wearing it.  All these data points feed directly into the Apple Health app without any intervention, making it super easy to track just how much or little you do in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204517"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-05-at-17-59-17.png" class="alignnone" width="1606" height="878" alt="Apple Watch Activity Tracking Overview" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final piece of hardware I have is an old set of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2v8Zg0N"&gt;Withings wifi scales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. (Withings was bought by Nokia, so these are now branded as Nokia...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump on these in the morning (... after your morning ablutions..) and your weight will be updated in Apple Health. It will also be available to apps you've allowed to read this data like MyFitnessPal, and others.  MFP will update its calorie predictions, as does the Activity tracking on the Apple Watch. If you stay standing on it long enough it will also do a heart rate reading and tell you the weather for the coming day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

I didn't have many goals for week 2, so we are going to skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/07/img_8555.jpg?w=2048" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1025" width="1024" height="768" alt="IMG_8555" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the POST TRUTH week #2...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk at least last weeks average steps per day, 8660.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go the gym 3 times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smash the rings on my Apple Watch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat healthily, drink less! (Should be easy after last week!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lose most of my holiday weight... 😲&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish a book I've already started reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get to the credits in any game I haven't completed before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend this week is getting back into the swing of being healthy &amp;amp; overall self improvement. After all my second half mudder isn't very far away...... 🤔&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2017 09:15:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2017-07-02:/2017/07/week-2/</guid><category>Real world</category><category>getting healthy</category></item><item><title>Week 1 - Recap</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2017/07/week-1-recap/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/07/untitled-picture.png?w=492" class="size-medium wp-image-989 alignleft" width="246" height="300" alt="Activity June 19th-25th" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My weekly activity started strong. I managed my active calorie ring every single day (time to up my target!), smashing it on the Monday + 32 minutes of 'exercise' &amp;amp; 14 hours standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Err, it all went downhill from there... I feel like I should at the very least be completing my Active Calories AND my Stand Goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really feel like I achieve the ring goals this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/07/week-1-goals.png?w=600" class="size-medium wp-image-996 aligncenter" width="300" height="156" alt="week 1 goals" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on to number 2... Well, I did not complete any workouts. And I feel bad. Hopefully this motivates me more next time! I think I will shorten the workouts to at least get them logged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#3... I started using RescueTime in conjuction with &lt;a href="https://exist.io/dashboard/"&gt;Exist.io&lt;/a&gt; which is a dashboard of 'everything':... Apple Health, Last.FM, the weather, productive time (more on this shortly), MyFitnessPal, and so many more. I would definitely recommend checking it out if you're into stats/data and want to see correlations from your own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems I am a lazy bum on the weekends, so I think I will go for a walk later....!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2017/07/screen-shot-2017-07-02-at-09-59-05.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1003" width="2252" height="968" alt="My Exist.io averages dashboard" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;My Exist.io averages dashboard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exist.io gets its productivity data from a service called '&lt;a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/"&gt;RescueTime&lt;/a&gt;'. This runs on my work computer only and basically tracks if what I am currently doing is productive or distracting. For the first few days, I was obsessing over the reports but now I am happy to just let it run and look every couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first full week, I wanted to hit 4 hours of 'productive' time a day. I logged 25h27m on RescueTime in total this week. 18h14m 'very productive', 2h17m 'productive', with less than 2.5 hours of distracting time. I spent 4 days in the office, so it seems  I smashed my 4 hour a day a goal! Result!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#4... I have a draft in Onenote waiting to be finalised! Spoiler, I played iOS games this week! Normal backlog service will resume soonish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#5... We went through some more stuff, but it's getting harder now. Sentimental value is kicking in! Perhaps better storage solutions are the key to happiness in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#6... See number 4...&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2017 09:07:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2017-07-02:/2017/07/week-1-recap/</guid><category>Real world</category><category>exist.io</category><category>health</category><category>rants</category><category>rescuetime</category></item><item><title>What I've Been Playing - Level 0</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2017/06/what-ive-been-playing-level-0/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0e/BreathoftheWildFinalCover.jpg" class="alignright" style="max-width:100%;" width="185" height="259" alt="Breath of the Wild" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't really gotten into anything much recently. Instead, I tried to play everything at the same time, and got bored of it all before too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started Breath of the Wild, accidentally wiped my save file, started again then didn't really go back to it. I played Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for about 20 hours in the two weeks after it came out, then haven't been back to it at all. Also on Switch I bought World of Goo, I am Setsuna, Disgaea 5, Minecraft and never really got into any of them. Whoops. Just need Stardew Valley so I can buy that too, then not play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On PS4 I got back into Formula 1 2016 picking up my save from last September on the super easy mode, because driving F1 cars is hard. I am currently enjoying thoroughly beating everyone even though they basically all forgot how to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2017/06/538567.jpg" class="wp-image-964 aligncenter" width="375" height="308" alt="F1 2016 on PS4" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;F1 2016 on PS4&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also started Dragon Quest Heroes. Are you seeing a trend yet? I like starting games, I like quitting them &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt;! I'll probably go back to Dragon Quest Heroes next month, or maybe next year. Long winded story games are basically my nemesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even started Omega Ruby again, with the hilarious plan of completing a Living Pokedex. It didn't happen when I was at uni with 30 hours a week spare, and I really doubt I will ever complete a living Pokedex now, or any time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward I am going to try and play a 'few' games a week, and blogg about them regularly. Maybe this will make me get through my backlog in a reasonable fashion. Maybe I could even set a target of beating 30 games before the end of 2018? We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://merph.net/blog/"&gt;This guy is basically a hero.&lt;/a&gt; I do wonder if he has a job or a wife, though. Over 5 hours a day just playing games!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games I played a bit of recently:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dragon Quest Heroes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zelda Picross&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magical Starsign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monster Hunter 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pokemon Omega Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games I plan on completing soon:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Nintendo Switch Parental Controls App on iOS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is designed for parents to be able to limit their children's playtime but you can disable all of that and just use it for the Activity Log goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On thing to note, you will need the Parental Control PIN occasionally... changing Wifi settings, to log into social accounts for sharing and stuff like that. The PIN is emailed to you and you can find it in the app, so you shouldn't lose it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (Tues 7th March)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your profile (click your icon in the top left corner of the home screen) you can see how long you've played a game for (for up to 100 hours..)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See this tweet....&lt;/p&gt;

I completed them both last week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2l7UOwo"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/02/fates-birthright.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-825" width="818" height="423" alt="fates-birthright" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two more games off the backlog! The girlfriend and I played Pokemon Snap to the credits in one sitting, and I completed &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2l7UOwo"&gt;FE Fates Birthright&lt;/a&gt; on super easy n00b mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever... I am not ashamed, I was totally just playing for the story! Plus, I don't have time for long-ass RPGs any more. So, having a way to breeze through the story was nice. Maybe one day I'll go back and play Conquest &amp;amp; Revelations. Probably not though... A snippet of my RPG backlog includes highlights such as &lt;a href="https://jamesleighton.com/2016/11/13/dragon-quest-vii-is-too-long-buts-its-ok/"&gt;Dragon Quest 7&lt;/a&gt;, several Final Fantasy Tactics games, several Disgaea games, Skyrim, Morrowind, Witcher 3... you get the idea....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed playing Fates on super-scrub mode, but I won't be going back any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/02/snap.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-832" width="608" height="459" alt="Pokemon Snap title screen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pokémon Snap was an awesome game. I genuinely don't know why we didn't play it sooner. We got to the credits in about 4 hours and caught about 95% of the Pokémon in the game. Thoughts include: 'WHY HASN'T NINTENDO MADE POKEMON SNAP 2!!!!!!', and 'FUCK YOU OAK! THAT PHOTO WAS AMAZING'. Great game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also discovered that two players can use different controllers but still control player 1 on the WiiU Virtual Console. This meant the gf could have the gamepad and I had a pro controller, and we didn't need to keep passing the controller. Something small, but pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2017 15:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2017-02-12:/2017/02/fire-emblem-pokemon-snap/</guid><category>gaming</category><category>3ds</category><category>backlog</category><category>fire emblem</category><category>pokemon</category><category>vc</category><category>wiiu</category></item><item><title>Executive Order: Ban the Beer - First Month Goals Update</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2017/02/executive-order-ban-the-beer-first-month-goals-update/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Over a month has passed since my last post, and in that time I have been (slowly) working towards those goals I &lt;a href="http://jamesleighton.com/2017/01/01/goals-and-motivation/"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't go to the gym that much, but I have been doing exercises at home (and on the road) with the help of my girlfriend who does 30-60 minutes a day in our flat. I even have resistance bands, and a roller!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have almost completely stopped drinking beer. In fact, I lost 8lbs which I am absolutely attributing to the lack of hoppy-malty goodness. I don't really even miss it that much... Which I thought I would! I have only had a single pint in three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to log successfully for about a 14 day streak in MyfitnessPal before I went off that wagon. Anyway, onto the stats!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2017/02/screen-shot-2017-02-12-at-14-42-32.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-792" width="1298" height="236" alt="screen-shot-2017-02-12-at-14-42-32" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;super motivational&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and should help me continue onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month I am going to the gym more often - at least twice a week when I am at home! Continue not drinking any/much at all beer. Continue with my Huel breakfast shakes (2 scoops, 300 calories), maybe extend these to lunchtimes* with a bit more trial and error, and keep eating healthy meals for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make basically an infinite amount of omelette variations... Spinach, tuna, chicken, ham, turkey, broccoli, asparagus.. The list is basically endless :) Omelette's are awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you again for 'update 2' in March!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*I tried this last week and failed absolutely miserably. I just couldn't deal with no having solid food for lunch. Maybe I should try again and take some healthy snacks into the office with me. Hmm!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 12 Feb 2017 14:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2017-02-12:/2017/02/executive-order-ban-the-beer-first-month-goals-update/</guid><category>life</category><category>getting healthy</category><category>gym</category><category>myfitnesspal</category></item><item><title>Goals and Motivation</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2017/01/goals-and-motivation/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out to be pretty hard to get motivated without concrete goals. I've spent the last year yoyo-ing on 'getting healthy' and never actually doing anything much about it. For a while after I moved, I even had two gym memberships (I used neither, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't ride a bike around anymore like when I lived at home - I don't have a bike or anywhere to store one. That summer I did though (just before Uni) I ended up weighing the lightest I've even been. I want to be somewhere around there again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2017, I figured I should try something a bit different! So, I've booked myself on two &lt;a href="https://toughmudder.co.uk/"&gt;Half Tough Mudders&lt;/a&gt;! One in May (four months from now) and the other in September (eight months from now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I have a gym membership again, and some vision of where I want to be in 132 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GOALS - you should have some!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5dDjFupvYs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how the fuck am I going to do this??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating considerably heathier / log most of my meals on an App&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am still undecided about what to do when I travel - 2/3 days a week on average away from home!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The eating at restaurants ruins me! The lack of any form of kitchen except a kettle (usually) makes this problematic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking much less than I currently do - &lt;a href="https://untappd.com/user/geekyjames"&gt;Untappd&lt;/a&gt; says I've checked 90 beers in the last 90 days. Too many!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercising&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously for Tough Mudder I need to be able to run/jog 5 miles, and haul my fat self over walls and shit. Therefore, I need to be able to actually run (ha!) and to actually gain some upper body strength. Losing some weight between now and May would likely be beneficial too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aiming to go 1-3 times a week (obviously more difficult when I am away for extended periods of time!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my diet wins and fails will be logged on Myfitnesspal, all my exercise related escapades will be on Runkeeper, and my weight will be tracked by Apple Health. I'll post an update in February (not that anyone actually cares except me:))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to send me a friend request on any of the mentioned services, leave a comment!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 19:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2017-01-01:/2017/01/goals-and-motivation/</guid><category>life, Uncategorized</category><category>eating</category><category>getting healthy</category><category>gym</category><category>myfitnesspal</category><category>runkeeper</category><category>tough mudder</category></item><item><title>Games Completed in 2017</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2017/01/games-completed-in-2017/</link><description>&lt;h2&gt;This post is to remind me that I should not buy a Nintendo Switch until I have completed a shit load more games that I ALREADY OWN!!!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be more games out then, they will be cheaper, and you do not need to spend over £300 in March just to play Zelda when you haven't finished most of the Zelda titles you already own. Stop being an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

In every way, it is exactly like the original games I spent so long with as a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only there were more mobile games like this! Imagine full versions of Theme Hospital, SimCity 2000, SimTower, Age of Empires.... It would be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2016/12/img_6571.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/12/img_6571.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-733" width="2048" height="1536" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I've played through an entire Park now (Dynamite Dunes) and everything feels perfect. The game plays exactly how I remember it, the touch controls are brilliant and I experienced no lag or crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2016/12/img_0087.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/12/img_0087.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-736" width="2048" height="1536" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My favourite addition is probably the extra speed controls. You can now make your Park run super speed, which is helpful when waiting to finish a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you liked the originals back in the day (or even still like &amp;amp; play them) then please buy RCT Classic and support decent mobile ports!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2016 18:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2016-12-25:/2016/12/roller-coaster-tycoon-ipad-android/</guid><category>misc</category><category>games</category><category>ipad</category><category>rct</category></item><item><title>+7 Days</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2016/11/7-days/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, my &lt;a href="http://jamesleighton.com/2016/11/13/90-days/"&gt;first week&lt;/a&gt; didn't start off that great. I ate pretty well for a few days  (Vegetarian feta and squash tart was something on the menu I wouldn't have otherwise tried!) then I got busy and everything went to shit. I have plans to balance this and prevent it from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/unadjustednonraw_thumb_714.png" class="wp-image-725 aligncenter" width="380" height="285" alt="unadjustednonraw_thumb_714" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have joined the gym! Again! (after cancelling about 3 months ago due to lack of time). This time I've paid upfront for a year... Motivation to go. Maybe. We'll see! It's not going to be that easy with me travelling around most weeks but I am going to try and go AT LEAST two days a week and more when I am at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also started bulk cooking this week! A &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/12798/chicken-tikka-masala"&gt;curry&lt;/a&gt;, and a scrumptious &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3228/chilli-con-carne"&gt;chilli&lt;/a&gt;. We made about 8 portions of each, so we're ready for 'I can't be arsed to cook, let's get a take away...'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We added chickpeas, spinach and butternut squash to the &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/12798/chicken-tikka-masala"&gt;curry&lt;/a&gt;, and it was both filling and tasty. I even think it could go without the chicken if you fancied it with no meat. Who really wants no meat though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-11-19-at-14-16-57.png?w=640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-731" width="320" height="328" alt="The home made curry paste in preparation" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;The home made curry paste in preparation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chilli was another &lt;a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3228/chilli-con-carne"&gt;BBC Good Food&lt;/a&gt; recipe, but doubled up. It was amazing on a baked potato, and I am really looking forward to it when we next have it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Chilli on baked potato with some cheese&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this week we stayed in London on Thursday night to see 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' which was really good. If you like Harry Potter at all, definitely see this film. It's basically what you want from a grittier more grown up version of the HP universe. Looking forward to the second one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some photos from London to finish...&lt;/p&gt;

I've finished Dragon Quest IV &amp;amp; V for the 3DS and I jumped head first into this one when it came out in September because it seemed right up my alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/1eb3348f-72ac-45cb-b994-943045754614-705-0000006924f2a4fc_tmp.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-668" width="1533" height="1374" alt="Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past Box Art" /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="img_container_A0226AF6-20FA-4356-AE3D-4C40012DEE8F" class="img_container"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span id="selectionBoundary_1479069600622_8378999099909353" class="rangySelectionBoundary" style="line-height:0;display:none;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It's &lt;a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=2843"&gt;one hundred hours long&lt;/a&gt;, though! I'm lucky if I get 7-10 hours a week to play, so I played quite a bit for a few weeks then made a fatal mistake. I got busy and put the game down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to it, I can see this is a quintessential JRPG from an age when longer meant better. Unfortunately, my play style doesn't match this anymore... It seems I prefer shorter RPGs, puzzle games, and racing games these days. I guess this matches the time I can invest into games!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/jackal27/status/785885479895826432&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There hasn't been an story arc I haven't liked so far. It's just that I'm only a third into the game... I picked it up and played another two or so islands for a few hours, then I had to go hunting for my tablets to progress even though I'd finished the story for those islands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a great game deserves to be beaten so it's going back on the shelf until I have some time to focus on it (when there are less games on my backlog.)&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't been living the healthiest lifestyle for the longest time, but now it's starting to show. And I hate it..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on the road quite a lot of the time is making it even worse. Did you know how fucking difficult it can be to eat well when you're travelling? Holy shit. It's hard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I went to uni in 2012 I lost quite a bit of weight by cycling a few times a week for summer. It was great, and I remember feeling fantastic. My first year at uni wasn't so bad, since I didn't have any money anyways to spend on crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell back into lazy ways over the next 3-4 years until today where I feel permanently bloated &amp;amp; incessantly tired all the damn time. Something has to give!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for the next 90 days I am going to log everything I eat on a spreadsheet (you can ask me for a link, if you want) and try to use this to positively influence my diet choices. I am not going to use something like MyFitnessPal because that just becomes a chore working out exactly how many calories and shit... I am literally going to have a few columns and rows for a date. I might even colour code by 'how good' the day was aka no beer, or no fries. Or shock horror... no bacon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really want to start Coach to 5 k (C25K), but I fear if I start that now I would destroy my ankles and probably keel over on day 2. Instead, I am going to try and go for increasingly more vigorous walks in all the places I end up visiting. Some of them are pretty damn nice!!&lt;/p&gt;

Enough to beat Bowser, see the credits, and get the game off my backlog.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/mario64.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-517" width="800" height="450" alt="mario64" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a genre defining game it stand apart from everything from it's era. However, if we look back through 2016-o-vision the cracks show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Mario's first foray into 3D environments and every level is unique and engaging, but the controls let it down in my opinion. This isn't really a flaw in the game, or even with the Nintendo 64 it ran on. We are just so used to twin sticks in modern games to play a 3D without them feels strange and unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twin sticks weren't even a thing until the year after Super Mario 64 was released (the Sony Dual Analog controller became available April 1997 for the Playstation) and not on Nintendo hardware until the Gamecube in 2001 over five years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it had, the game controlled well and even translated quite decently to a DS remaster a decade ago. The levels were fantastic (nothing felt rushed, or repeated, or a lazy cop out), the music sublime, and this game is rightly considered a classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a shame that Nintendo's Virtual Console is too dark, as you can see in these screenshots. You could always play on actual hardware (but I am never going be buying old consoles.. I have enough crap as it is) or resort to other solutions like emulating the game yourself on something like RetroPie or your normal computer. Why can't Nintendo fix the darkness issue? Who knows.. Maybe they will on the NX (as they get us to 'upgrade' our virtual console libraries again...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I will ever go back and get all 120 stars. I'd probably snap my controller in half, and I have a hell of a backlog to get through anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2016-08-24:/2016/08/retro-thoughts-super-mario-64-2/</guid><category>backlog, games, nintendo</category></item><item><title>Spotify &amp; Last.FM on iPhone and iPads</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2016/08/spotify-last-fm-on-iphone-and-ipads/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Spotify Last.FM scrobbling seems to break fairly regularly, the fix unfortunately is to log out of the Spotify app, remove the spotify app, reinstall the spotify app then as if by magic you will be scrobbling again.

&lt;p&gt;Annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/spotify.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2016-08-21:/2016/08/spotify-last-fm-on-iphone-and-ipads/</guid><category>misc</category><category>ios</category></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Spotify Jukebox</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2016/07/raspberry-pi-spotify-jukebox/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a simple to use office based music jukebox that everyone can use and no-one can take overall control of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs to be clear, simple, and intuitive. It should be reliable, and not require manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi (I used a 3, probably could have used an older model)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaker with aux-in (Could use Bluetooth, but to keep things simple I didn't)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aux cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspbian Lite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mopidy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotmop Plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotify Premium Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by installing your Linux distrubtion of choice on your Pi, I used [distro here].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head over to the &lt;a href="https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/"&gt;Mopidy project page&lt;/a&gt;, and have a read through their Raspi Jessie instructions. You will need the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify"&gt;Spotify plugin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-scrobbler"&gt;Last.Fm plugin&lt;/a&gt; if you wish to have a record of all the &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/user/office-music"&gt;music you play&lt;/a&gt;. You may still need to &lt;a href="https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-scrobbler/issues/20"&gt;manually fix the scrobbler&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like this is getting fixed soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pi Auxilary Audio Out is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/2yu3kd/rpi_2_poor_audio_quality/"&gt;terrible&lt;/a&gt;. I should probably spend more time figuring out bluetooth since the speaker we use supports it. Alternatively, you could use a HDMI to 3.5mm adapter which apparently will give you better sound. Or you could use a USB Sound card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to figure out how to save the volume level as the default so on a reboot I do not need to SSH in and reset the volume [command line snippet here next time I go to the office]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2016-07-24:/2016/07/raspberry-pi-spotify-jukebox/</guid><category>howto</category><category>projects</category><category>raspberry pi</category></item><item><title>Why did I wait so long to play Uncharted?</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2016/07/why-did-i-wait-so-long-to-play-uncharted/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I had a PS3 for years, and never played Uncharted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/uncharted.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-564" width="1280" height="720" alt="uncharted" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a PS4 in November. It came with the &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/29dtFkp"&gt;Uncharted collection&lt;/a&gt;. I still didn't play it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally.. after much prodding from a work colleague I put the disk in and got stuck in. Holy crap! What an amazing game! I've only played Drake's Fortune but wow. Just wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole game is paced spectacularly; I never had a dull moment; the difficulty curve was great (the mutants can go fuck themselves!!); and the story was neither too long (Looking at you: Every JRPG ever) or too short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/10 - Best game I've played so far this year. If you have a PS4 and you haven't got it... Go &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/29dtFkp"&gt;buy it&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to leave 2 &amp;amp; 3 for a while whilst I catch up some of other games.. Maybe Fallout 4, or something portable like &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/29aqJDI"&gt;Fire Emblem&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever takes my fancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2016-07-02:/2016/07/why-did-i-wait-so-long-to-play-uncharted/</guid><category>misc</category><category>backlog</category><category>ps4</category><category>uncharted</category></item><item><title>Homepass with a Raspberry Pi 3</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2016/06/homepass-with-a-raspberry-pi-3/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I used to use &lt;a href="http://homepass.info/"&gt;Homepass&lt;/a&gt; a few years back but my old Pi broke and I never got around to replacing it. I bought a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/"&gt;Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/a&gt;'s recently and decided to put one to use as a StreetPass relay for my and my girlfriend's 3DS as we seem to live in a desert of 3DS's right now. Shame!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi 3 is perfect for this purpose as you need nothing more than an ethernet cable to your router and power. No need for a USB wireless adapter making everything that much simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're wondering what Homepass or Streetpass is, then no fear...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HomePass is a homebrew method of fooling your 3DS system into believing a Global StreetPass Relay exists in your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo released an update to the 3DS StreetPass system in the beginning of August 2013, that would allow users to receive and transmit StreetPass data via Nintendo Zone Wifi Access Points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo calls this new system “StreetPass Relay”. Over at GBATemp.net, great minds came together and figured out how to utilize your home WiFi Router/Access Point as a Nintendo Zone StreetPass Relay — but not just a local one, a GLOBAL relay. You will be able to StreetPass people from around the world. Want tons of streetpasses in a single day, without ever leaving the house? Read on :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found some instructions and an image on Reddit which you can find &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/4h8exo/so_ive_managed_to_get_a_raspberry_pi_3_working_as/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This preprepared image deals with the bridging, firewall rules, run schedule etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using Windows, try using Win32diskimager to write the Pi image to your SD card. On a Mac, I used Apple Pi Baker to great success. I tried a couple of times using terminal but it wouldn't boot successfully. Apple Pi Baker solved my issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have mine set as default to attempt to run every 6 minutes, with a 2% chance of succeeding. The default is 20%. Every six minutes, the script will attempt to start the access point with a Relay MAC address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is effectively a roll of the dice, as you don't need to be getting StreetPass hits every 6 minutes all day. Well, maybe you do. Then you can set the run chance to 100%. My relay should effectively run 6&lt;em&gt;24&lt;/em&gt;.02 times per day on average (about 3) which suits my needs perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Streetpassing!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2016-06-23:/2016/06/homepass-with-a-raspberry-pi-3/</guid><category>gaming</category><category>3ds</category><category>raspberry pi</category></item><item><title>Games completed so far in 2016</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2016/06/games-completed-so-far-in-2016/</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2016-06-19:/2016/06/games-completed-so-far-in-2016/</guid><category>misc</category><category>3ds</category><category>backlog</category><category>ps4</category></item><item><title>How I Learnt To Stop Buying Games</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2016/05/how-i-learnt-to-stop-buying-games/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I know I've bought a lot of games since I got my Steam account way back in 2009. I didn't realise just how stupid it had gotten though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot of my Backloggery (a service for tracking game completion!), maybe one day I will finish all these...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://backloggery.com/ZombieUnicorn"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/backloggery16.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-476" width="996" height="1136" alt="backloggery16" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided my Backloggery is only going to have console games (handheld included) and Steam games I have played to completion as I honestly have no intention of playing the vast majority of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed my Steam games, but have re-added them back under the 'null' status so they do not affect the stats. Honestly, most of these games were bought for dirt cheap in sales and there is probably only 25-30 I actually want to complete (HL series, Fallout/Elder Scrolls, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take the 204 games above, and played them for a conservation 15 hours each then you have 127.5 days worth of games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, if I managed to play around 10 hours a week they would take ridiculous 306 weeks to finish...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... No More Games!! Or, being realistic: I need to complete 10 to buy one new 1, and I need to focus on the shorter games in my collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I finished the story in GTA V (which was amazing), completed Return to Popolocrois: A Story of Season Fairy Tale (which I recommend if you like JRPGs) and I am currently playing Pokemon Yellow (going for a complete dex might take a while though...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to focus on one game at a time seems to be speeding up my progress. I will probably be moving on to the games I've nearly completed next: Luigi's Mansion 2 &amp;amp; Kirby Triple Deluxe. I think I am going to focus on one 'smaller' game (like Picross or a 2D Mario game) and one 'larger' game like Skyrim or Xenoblade at a time so I don't get bored of any single game at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck! Hopefully by 2017 I will have a completion rate on backloggery of over 30% (62 games!!)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2016 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2016-05-30:/2016/05/how-i-learnt-to-stop-buying-games/</guid><category>backlog, games</category></item><item><title>Scotland Trip - Fort William to Edinburgh via Mallaig - Part 2/2</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2016/03/scotland-trip-fort-william-to-edinburgh-via-mallaig-part-22/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We left on the West Highland line for a short two hour run to Mallaig, this line has apparently been voted one of the most scenic railway journeys in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fort William to Mallaig: 41 miles (Running total: 683 miles)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/012.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-593" width="1500" height="1125" alt="01" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenfinnan_Viaduct"&gt;Glenfinnan Viaduct&lt;/a&gt; which you might remember featuring in the Harry Potter movies, and were shortly in Mallaig; a small coastal ferry port on the west coast of the Highlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/022.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-594" width="1500" height="1125" alt="02" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief stop at the B&amp;amp;B, we found the lifeboat and the two pubs. My 100th beer on Untapped was actually in Mallaig.. Tennent’s Lager at The Steam Inn! Probably could of made a better choice for the 100th, but nevermind now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/032.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-595" width="1500" height="404" alt="03" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early to rise the next day, we got the 6.02 to Glasgow Queen Street and settled in for the six hour journey. Along the way, we saw the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrour_railway_station"&gt;highest station&lt;/a&gt; on the network (it's also 10 miles from the nearest public road) and lots and lots of mountains. It was the prettiest of all of journeys all week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mallaig to Glasgow Queen Street: 161 miles (Running total: 844 miles)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="598,597,596" type="rectangular" orderby="rand"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the Glasgow and found the obligatory Spoons for lunch then headed to [Central Station for our tour] we’d booked weeks before. I highly recommend the tour if you ever find yourself in Glasgow as the guide (a former station manager) is full of knowledge and excitement about the station and it’s history of the last century. The story about the fish and chip shop was a highlight, but you’ll have to go and do the tour yourself to hear it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing out of a side corridor behind the ticket barriers was amusing, and confused the commuters who we emerged into. I imagine they were considering just why we were wearing hivis and orange caps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="599,600" type="rectangular"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen quid might seem a bit steep, but no. Just do it. Paul makes it well worth it, he doesn’t have [771+ 5 Star reviews on TripAdvisor] for nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stop on our adventure was Edinburgh, and the final night of our holiday. We checked in, and started exploring. I took us back to The Boozy Cow for dinner (I went last year when I was in Edinburgh last) and it was just as good as I remembered. Afterwards, we found a cocktail bar called Panda and Sons. Worth a visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glasgow Central to Edinburgh Waverley: 46 miles (Running Total 890 miles)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="602,601" type="rectangular"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we headed back to Glasgow, found a Wetherspoons (lol, ....) and went to the airport to catch our flight that afternoon. We didn't do much, and I don't have any more interesting photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my next trip blog, I am going to dissect from Untappd history from the week, and talk about all the fun beers I tried!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Glasgow on Saturday morning, the flight was fine (the breakfast not...) and headed into Glasgow city to get our train onwards. We travelled on a rover ticket which was pretty cool in itself, £118 for 8 days of travel within 15 days which I'll talk about in the next blog post.&lt;br&gt;
￼&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="/images/2024/02/c295b-5015f38541.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2024/02/c295b-5015f38541.jpg" class="img-fluid" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glasgow Queen Street to Aberdeen: 155 miles (Running total 155 miles)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen was our first destination, Brewdog Brewery our goal. The train to Aberdeen was uneventful, we found our hotel and went to find the bus to Ellon.&lt;br&gt;
The bus that greeted us was fairly fancy; a coach with USB ports and reclining seats! It was a comfy ride to Ellon.&lt;br&gt;
Brewdog was a short walk away from the bus stop but it was pissing it down so felt like an age. But once we got there... It was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2024/02/f67ca-d272255e6c.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we headed to Inverness. It snowed a bit, but nothing major. In fact, it was the most snow we saw all week.&lt;br&gt;
Before we left for Inverness we had something to do... Find the RNLI Lifeboat which Laurence actually started the wiki page for...&lt;br&gt;
I didn't actually get a photo of the boat, but I did take this cool timelapse. Laurence probably has some video from his GoPro he hasn't bothered to watch since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen to Inverness: 108 miles (Running total: 263 miles)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't do much in Inverness; looked for cheap GoPro accessories for Laurence and found somewhere to drink. We didn't find any accessories that weren't fifty quid, but we did find a Wetherspoons so not all bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverness to Wick: 161 miles (Running Total: 424 miles)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards to the far north of Scotland. We got a 7am train to Wick/Thurso the next day. It was fairly desolate and remote, but Wick bigger than we were both expecting. I think we've now frequented the most northerly branch of Wetherspoons in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the bus to John o Groats and think we were pretty much the only tourists around this early in March. Everyone else on the bus had their shopping..&lt;br&gt;
Fun fact.. John o Groats is not the most northerly point of the mainland UK. That is nearby Dunnet Head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/2024/02/efb7f-0ac34a3852.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;￼&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, we've done John o Groats! Ten minutes of taking photos of the sign, and an 1 hour 50 minutes waiting for the next bus.. Hmm. Anyway, we got to Thurso late afternoon and checked in to our hotel for the night.&lt;br&gt;
There was nothing to do in Thurso. We had a pint in the hotel bar and went for a wander. We literally didn't find a single pub, and ended up having dinner at a local Chinese restaurant.&lt;br&gt;
We got the first train out the next morning back to Inverness along the line we were on the day before where we stopped for lunch, and caught the coach to Fort William.&lt;br&gt;
Thurso to Fort William: 218 miles including the coach (Running total: 642 miles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Glasgow on Saturday morning, the flight was fine (the breakfast not...) and headed into Glasgow city to get our train onwards. We travelled on a rover ticket which was pretty cool in itself, £118 for 8 days of travel within 15 days which I'll talk about in the next blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/01.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-572" width="1500" height="427" alt="01" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glasgow Queen Street to Aberdeen: 155 miles (Running total 155 miles)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen was our first destination, Brewdog Brewery our goal. The train to Aberdeen was uneventful, we found our hotel and went to find the bus to Ellon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus that greeted us was fairly fancy; a coach with USB ports and reclining seats! It was a comfy ride to Ellon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brewdog was a short walk away from the bus stop but it was pissing it down so felt like an age. But once we got there... It was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[gallery ids="576,575,574,577" type="rectangular" orderby="rand"]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we headed to Inverness. It snowed a bit, but nothing major. In fact, it was the most snow we saw all week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we left for Inverness we had something to do... Find the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_Lifeboat_Station"&gt;RNLI Lifeboat&lt;/a&gt; which Laurence actually started the wiki page for...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't actually get a photo of the boat, but I did take this cool timelapse. Laurence probably has some video from his GoPro he hasn't bothered to watch since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post I'll write about the scenic railway to Mallaig; and our trip to Glasgow and Edinburgh. &lt;a href="http://www.jamesleighton.com/blog/2016/03/scotland-glasgow-to-thurso"&gt;Read it here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2016-03-20:/2016/03/scotland-trip-glasgow-to-fort-william-via-john-o-groats-part-12/</guid><category>Uncategorized</category><category>beer</category><category>scotland</category><category>train</category></item><item><title>Scotland Trip - Fort William to Edinburgh via Mallaig - Part 2/2</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2016/03/scotland-trip-fort-william-to-edinburgh-via-mallaig-part-2-2/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We left on the West Highland line for a short two hour run to Mallaig, this line has apparently been voted one of the most scenic railway journeys in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Fort William to Mallaig: 41 miles (Running total: 683 miles)**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![01](/images/2016/11/012.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We passed the [Glenfinnan Viaduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenfinnan_Viaduct) which you might remember featuring in the Harry Potter movies, and were shortly in Mallaig; a small coastal ferry port on the west coast of the Highlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![02](/images/2016/11/022.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief stop at the B&amp;amp;B, we found the lifeboat and the two pubs. My 100th beer on Untapped was actually in Mallaig.. Tennent’s Lager at The Steam Inn! Probably could of made a better choice for the 100th, but nevermind now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![03](/images/2016/11/032.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early to rise the next day, we got the 6.02 to Glasgow Queen Street and settled in for the six hour journey. Along the way, we saw the [highest station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrour_railway_station) on the network (it's also 10 miles from the nearest public road) and lots and lots of mountains. It was the prettiest of all of journeys all week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Mallaig to Glasgow Queen Street: 161 miles (Running total: 844 miles)**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the Glasgow and found the obligatory Spoons for lunch then headed to \[Central Station for our tour\] we’d booked weeks before. I highly recommend the tour if you ever find yourself in Glasgow as the guide (a former station manager) is full of knowledge and excitement about the station and it’s history of the last century. The story about the fish and chip shop was a highlight, but you’ll have to go and do the tour yourself to hear it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Appearing out of a side corridor behind the ticket barriers was amusing, and confused the commuters who we emerged into. I imagine they were considering just why we were wearing hivis and orange caps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen quid might seem a bit steep, but no. Just do it. Paul makes it well worth it, he doesn’t have \[771+ 5 Star reviews on TripAdvisor\] for nothing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stop on our adventure was Edinburgh, and the final night of our holiday. We checked in, and started exploring. I took us back to The Boozy Cow for dinner (I went last year when I was in Edinburgh last) and it was just as good as I remembered. Afterwards, we found a cocktail bar called Panda and Sons. Worth a visit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Glasgow Central to Edinburgh Waverley: 46 miles (Running Total 890 miles)**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we headed back to Glasgow, found a Wetherspoons (lol, ....) and went to the airport to catch our flight that afternoon. We didn't do much, and I don't have any more interesting photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my next trip blog, I am going to dissect from Untappd history from the week, and talk about all the fun beers I tried!&lt;/p&gt;

I don't know what I want to do with myself now, but I know that it will have nothing to do with chemistry. Everyone's asked me 'What are you doing next?' and honestly I have no idea. I gained a degree, over three stone in weight and absolutely no direction for my future. I need direction and some healthy living!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uni was a fantastic experience; I met loads of really cool people along the way. I can see myself still being great friends with more than a few in years to come, but I don't think university is for everyone and if I could choose to do the last three years over I'm not entirely sure I'd do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being bad at exams meant GCSEs and (what I completed of) AS Levels at school were a struggle, but I got through them. I left school to go to college to study for a National Diploma in Applied Science and it was ace since exams weren't a thing I had to content with any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carried on to do a HND in Applied Chemistry and got a merit. It was awesome, and no exams meant that whilst I had to understand the content I didn't have to cram it all into my brain to splurge back out onto an exam paper. Going to 'proper' uni in 2012 was a major wake up call. I struggled massively in exams, and even had to retake a year because whilst I passed my dissertation relatively well, I'd completely fucked up my exams. Everyone else around me had always done well in exams, and I just didn't get them. I'd not done an exam in nearly five years and just didn't know how to revise and study for one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don't really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if anyone ever reads this I'd say think long and hard about whether a degree is right for you. If you're shit at exams like me then it'll be a massive uphill struggle. I don't really know if my degree is going to be of any use to me ever other than to say "I have a degree". I certainly don't like chemistry like I did five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I've started self studying for a CCNA qualification (on the advice of a close friend) which is something I'm actually interested in and have been for a long time. Looking back, maybe this should of been my path a couple of years back. Ah well, I'm still young :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2015-08-03:/2015/08/graduation/</guid><category>misc</category><category>graduate</category><category>life</category><category>uni</category></item><item><title>Too many games, not enough time</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2015/02/too-many-games-not-enough-time/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a while since I posted anything on my blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent Christmas in South Wales, passed my January exams, and completed some games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super Mario 3D World was completed with the help of my girlfriend (We've not started the bonus challenge levels yet.), I got around to finishing Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies at last. Pretty good, but I should probably skip novel-like games in the future. I also completed Dragon Quest IV on the DS which had been nearly completed for months. That was a lot of fun, the last battle was phenomenally difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it's back to studying for May exams (last ones ever!) and playing of more games in the between hours of uni/work/uni/work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought Monster Hunter 4 this week so I could experience the online whilst it was still new. I'm also slowly playing through Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker and Fallout: New Vegas. Time is precious! Oh, I got an ambassador New 3DS too which I've been meaning to review at some point!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2015 18:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2015-02-20:/2015/02/too-many-games-not-enough-time/</guid><category>misc</category><category>games</category><category>nintendo</category><category>uni</category></item><item><title>Fantasy Life Item Duping/Duplication</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/11/fantasy-life-item-dupingduplication/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;There is a simple way to duplicate any item that is stackable by using the streetpass functionality built into Fantasy Life for Nintendo 3DS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/fantasy-life.jpg" class="size-full wp-image-495 aligncenter" width="347" height="253" alt="fantasy-life" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fantasy Life's Streetpass revolves around choosing an item you wish to give to passers-by. However, it does not take the item from you....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been found that you can choose multiples of an item to give away. Let's start low... how about a stack of gold ore? Well now you and your friend has that stack of gold ore. I'm sure you can see where this is going! How about some Life Cures? They'll come in handy no doubt. &lt;a href="http://reveriaexplorer.com/items/652"&gt;Rare ores&lt;/a&gt; like magic or, marine ore, maybe something from the DLC (which I've yet to bother buying) are all pretty good ideas. Mine or buy a stack of 99 of them, and voila. You'll soon have 198 or them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what your friends want, and tell them what you want and you can be rich together!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2014 09:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-11-09:/2014/11/fantasy-life-item-dupingduplication/</guid><category>gaming</category><category>3ds</category><category>glitch</category></item><item><title>SSH Login Notifications using Pushbullet</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/11/ssh-login-notifications-using-pushbullet/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Pushbullet is a great app that allows you to share notifications to and from your phone/computer. I recently saw &lt;a href="https://deadmanssnitch.com/" title="Dead Man's Snitch"&gt;Dead Man's Snitch&lt;/a&gt; (a service which alerts you about cron jobs) and figured I could probably replicate the most important functionality for me using Pushbullet. After all, being a poor student is all about saving as much money as possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing around with the &lt;a href="https://docs.pushbullet.com/" title="Pushbullet API Documentation"&gt;Pushbullet API&lt;/a&gt; whilst setting up backup notifications for my servers, I wondered if I could get a push notification every time (hopefully) just me logged in via SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up with the following bash script that can be added to your bash login script (\~/.bash_profile)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col style="width: 50%" /&gt;
&lt;col style="width: 50%" /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class="odd"&gt;
&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1
2
3
4
5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/bash
IP=($SSH_CLIENT)
name=$(whoami)
string=&amp;quot;SSH Login from $IP for $name&amp;quot;
/home/admin/pushbullet/pushbullet push all note &amp;quot;$string&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It uses this library from &lt;a href="https://github.com/Red5d/pushbullet-bash"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, but could do it without the library at all if you're not as lazy as I am. More Pushbullet goodness soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/pushbullet.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-544" width="540" height="350" alt="pushbullet" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2014 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-11-08:/2014/11/ssh-login-notifications-using-pushbullet/</guid><category>linux</category><category>geek</category></item><item><title>Namecheap SSL Tutorial (Lighttpd)</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/11/namecheap-ssl-tutorial-lighttpd/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Namecheap's cheap SSL certificates work great on desktop, but are missing the root cert therefore gave me an untrusted error on Android (and I assume iOS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a while trying to figure out how to fix this, and I finally have!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the zip file they send you, combine the files using cat like this. The order is important for the mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    cat COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt COMODORSAAddTrustCA.crt AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt &gt; bundle

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add your private key and certificate from Namecheap (domain_tld.crt file) to a single file, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    cat privatekeyhere.key domain_tld.crt &gt; certificate.pem

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use whatever names you want for the outputted files. Just make them consistent. You should probably make sure only your &lt;a href="http://blog.chrismeller.com/creating-and-managing-ssl-certificates-with-nginx"&gt;web-server/root&lt;/a&gt; user can read them to keep them secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally in your lighttpd.conf add something like the following to enable SSL globally for your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    $SERVER["socket"] == "ip.address:443" 
    {

    server.document-root = "/var/www/"
    ssl.engine = "enable"

    ssl.use-sslv2 = "disable"
    ssl.use-sslv3 = "disable"

    ssl.ca-file = "/path/to/bundle"
    ssl.pemfile = "/path/to/certificate.pem"

    }

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To force SSL connections only, you'll want to add something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    $SERVER["socket"] == ":80" 
    {
            $HTTP["host"] =~ "(.*)" 
            {
                    url.redirect = ( "^/(.*)" =&gt; "https://%1/$1" )
            }

Slowly now that uni is back on, but still a few hours a week helps massively. In September (I realise its almost November as I type this, shh) I completed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saints_Row:_The_Third"&gt;Saint's Row the Third&lt;/a&gt; after reinstalling it to see if it'd finally work on my PC. It did! So I continued where I left off in January 2012 and completed the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2015/08/saintsrow.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-326" width="320" height="263" alt="saintsrow" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a blast. (Upon reading back after drafting this, that pun wasn't intended. Honestly!) It reminded me a lot of GTA of years gone by. I didn't really like GTA V that much prefering Grand Theft Auto of my childhood like GTA 3 and Vice City. (Never did play San Andreas much! I will one day)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is a pretty typical crime drama. Gang takes over town. Gang threatened by city. Go! Shoot people, get shot, steal things, escort hookers back to their pimps, shoot pedestrians from you manapult, play in a gameshow like &lt;a href="http://saintsrow.wikia.com/Professor_Genki's_Super_Ethical_Reality_Climax"&gt;Takeshi's Castle&lt;/a&gt; crossed with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Wipeout"&gt;Total Wipeout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2015/08/genki.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-284" width="500" height="289" alt="Ethical Reality Climax" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Ethical Reality Climax&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except there are guns. I'm pretty glad I completed it. I'll have to go back and tidy up some of the side story lines completely, but at least I completed the main story start to finish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/dreamland.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-494" width="250" height="251" alt="Kirby&amp;#39;s Dream Land cover art" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Kirby's Dream Land cover art&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changing pace completely, I got around to beating &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby's_Dream_Land"&gt;Kirby's Dream Land&lt;/a&gt; on 3DS Virtual Console. It's a bit of a special game for me, as I'm 99% sure it was the first gameboy game that I ever played alongside Super Mario Land. I think it took me an hour. I wish I'd done it years ago. Anyway, it inspired me to buy Kirby Triple Deluxe which is fun so far. I'll probably beat it this month or next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I'm playing through Disgaea 3 on the PS3 and &lt;a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/"&gt;Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale&lt;/a&gt;. I'll probably play a ton more Fantasy life this month too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 13:19:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-10-24:/2014/10/kirby-and-the-third-street-saints/</guid><category>games</category><category>backlog</category></item><item><title>Finished - Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition for Nintendo 3DS</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/08/finished-legend-of-zelda-four-swords-anniversary-edition-for-nintendo-3ds/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I finally finished &lt;a href="http://zelda.com/fourswordsanniversary/" title="The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition"&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo 3DS this week. I've been trying to play it at my local &lt;a href="http://www.streetpassnorthwales.co.uk/" title="StreetPass North Wales"&gt;Streetpass&lt;/a&gt; events for nearly a year, but we always get distracted by the event or no-one wants to play it/has it downloaded to their console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/zelda-logo.png" class="size-full wp-image-567 aligncenter" width="450" height="308" alt="zelda-logo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time was different! We set up an event purely for the purposes of completing Four Swords, and we accomplished our goal. We even finished the retro themed Realms of Memories stages which are based on Legend of Zelda from the NES, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. They were awesome reminders of the games and evoked some memories of those that I've actually played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/zelda-realmofmemories.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-568" width="767" height="190" alt="zelda-realmofmemories" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fun fact about Four Swords: it was the first appearance of what was the become the concept for the Minish Cap. Known as the &lt;a href="http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Gnat_Hat" title="Gnat Hat"&gt;Gnat Hat&lt;/a&gt; it allowed players to shrink to a fraction of their usual size. In the Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap the same thing occurs via &lt;a href="http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Ezlo"&gt;Ezlo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/zelda-gnat-ezlo.png" class="size-full wp-image-566 aligncenter" width="223" height="163" alt="zelda-gnat-ezlo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed playing through Four Swords at the pub. The atmosphere was great, and maybe more than once we threw each other into lava or onto spikes. It's seriously good fun, and it's a shame that was a time limited download both in Europe years ago, and the US back in January 2014. I wonder why they don't just charge £5 for it and let people give them money? Oh, Nintendo you so crazy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll probably have to get together at some point to 100% it, since the last thing left to do is the Hero's Trials which are (obviously) more difficult stages meant to test you and your friends. Perhaps we'll do that one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, that's one off of the backlog! Success. What next? Phoenix Wright Dual Destinies and Terraria for PC!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2014 20:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-08-30:/2014/08/finished-legend-of-zelda-four-swords-anniversary-edition-for-nintendo-3ds/</guid><category>3ds, backlog, zelda</category></item><item><title>The backlogged road is long!</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/06/the-backlogged-road-is-long/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I am slowly making progress through my backlog. Maybe by 2045 I'll complete it.... From the first list of games to play that I posted after exams ended in May, I tried to spend time on Bad Rats (but it kept crashing), played some Hack Slash and Loot (doubt I'll make it to an hour, I really don't like it that much) and started on Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm quite enjoying Fate of Atlantis and it's reminded me how much I enjoy old LucasArts point and click adventures. I'll have to stop off at Monkey Island soon. They're just so much fun! Anyway whilst I continue to play OpenTTD and ignore my backlog, I thought I'd create a top games list for each of my backlogged console platforms. Here goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2015/08/openttd.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-313" width="829" height="747" alt="openttd" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WiiU&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lego Hobbit (15h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earthbound (30h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pikmin 3 (15h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've done a few days in Pikmin 3, and I've completed a chunk of LEGO Hobbit. I'll probably just keep doing time trials in Mario Kart 8, though. Add me on Miiverse if you want to: geekyjames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3DS/DS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phoenix Wright Dual Destinies (30h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask (25h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magical Starsign (40h)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm on the 3rd case in Dual Destinies, likely going to have to restart Miracle Mask due to forgetting the story and hopefully able to get over the slooooow text in Magical Starsign although I couldn't last time I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vita/PSP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heh, the screenshots do it better justice... Let's just say I've not started any of these really... I should pick one at random and aim to complete it. The random number generator said 3, 7, and 23... which are... Final Fantasy Tactics, Lemmings (I can finish that!), and Hotline Miami. I'll give that my best shot...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PS3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assassins Creed series, Ni No Kuni, Burnout CRASH... So many Playstation Plus games, that honestly makes me wonder why I bother paying around £40 a year for games that I'm likely not going to play since I still buy games on the PSN Store... At least I didn't buy a single game in the latest steam sale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to crack on, shame I'm back at work for nine days starting this week... At least I've finally moved house, and have few responsibilities if any until October when uni starts back up!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2014 23:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-06-30:/2014/06/the-backlogged-road-is-long/</guid><category>games</category><category>3ds</category><category>backlog</category><category>gaming</category><category>geek</category><category>ps3</category><category>steam</category></item><item><title>Why do I get so many Gmail emails to my google account that aren't for me?</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/06/why-do-i-get-so-many-gmail-emails-to-my-google-account-that-arent-for-me/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, I have had firstname.lastname@gmail.com for many years. Maybe as early as 2004 or 2005, I can't remember. For the last few I've been receiving random emails addressed to my address but aren't for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some from a college in the US, a guy in Western Australia and someone in Essex who routinely give my email address when asked for theirs. The college let me log in and see the guys address, and someone sent the guy in the UK bank details in plain text. Overall, it's more amusing that annoying but it can get frustrating. Today I received emails from Sprint eBilling and a random UK webhost thanking me for my business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I think I solved it. I think that Google's regional email domains for Gmail aren't equivalent from what I can tell, so firstname.lastname@gmail.com isn't the same as firstname.lastname@gmail.com.au or firstname.lastname@gmail.co.uk. Doesn't explain the guy in the US, but it fits pretty well. I should probably email those accounts and see if I can get a response. I'm not sure how this works with @googlemail.co.uk etc that was in use in the UK for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not nearly as bad as the guy in Canada who used one of my domains as his administration contact within the whois for many of his domains. The amount of emails I received from GoDaddy was insane.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jun 2014 21:39:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-06-19:/2014/06/why-do-i-get-so-many-gmail-emails-to-my-google-account-that-arent-for-me/</guid><category>misc</category><category>email</category><category>google</category><category>internet</category></item><item><title>The Steaming Backlog of Steam Games</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/05/the-steaming-backlog-of-steam-games/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1jg15u/so_i_actually_cleared_my_massive_steam_backlog/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; that I was reading whilst procrastinating, I've come up with a nice system for dealing with my Steam backlog that's approaching nearly four hundred games... Gotta do something. And not change the password and forget it exists...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the idea is to play every game for at least 1 hour to see if I enjoy it. If not, whatever, it's done. Move on, if I do then keep playing. Easy? I've inputted my steam games into Excel (via SteamDB and excel's Web data input wizard) and sorted them into one of four categories. Those I haven't touched at all, or haven't reach an hour in. Those that I've actually completed properly, ones that I am going to skip over and others that I might go back to later. The latter three all count as "completed" for backlog purposes. I'll sort out separate lists for PS3, Gog.com games, 3DS and Vita titles that I own too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to Play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One Hour Completed, It's DONE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Might Continue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Backlog Categories" src="/images/steaming-backlog01.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I've selected the first game that appears for each letter. The first batch is as follows. I think I'll actually complete more than a few of these (Machinarium, Doodles are Bugged) but there are more than a handful of massive games too (GalCiv, East India Company). I have been meaning to try them at some point, and now I can. This will probably take me till at least the Summer holidays. Wish me luck! Not a lot will get played before exams are over in three weeks. Time to ~~play games~~ revise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ace of Spades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad Rats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carrier Command: Gaea Mission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;East India Company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F.E.A.R.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galactic Civilizations II: Ultimate Edition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hack, Slash, Loot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jamestown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Killing Floor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lead and Gold Gangs of the Wild West&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machinarium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Napoleon: Total War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paranautical Activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RAW Realms of Ancient War&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saira&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take Command: Second Manassas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UFO: Afterlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wargame: European Escalation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Doodles Are Bugged!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zen Bound® 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiplayer only games can be skipped entirely if I can't find anyone to play them with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games incompatible with my PC can be skipped entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2014 17:24:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-05-02:/2014/05/the-steaming-backlog-of-steam-games/</guid><category>gaming</category><category>backlog</category><category>steam</category></item><item><title>Betws-Y-Coed Miniature Railway Trip</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/04/betws-y-coed-miniature-railway-trip/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betws-y-Coed_railway_station" title="Betws-Y-Coed Station Wikipedia Article"&gt;Betws-Y-Coed station&lt;/a&gt;, there is a railway museum and miniature railway. The museum entry fee was £1.50, and so were tickets on the miniature railway. Having nearly run out of pennies, we decided to hop on the miniature railway, as you do. We even got cute little tickets which the driver checked...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/ticket.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-571" width="378" height="203" alt="Miniature Railway Ticket" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Miniature Railway Ticket&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only when the train started and a family with young children walked onto the platform did we realise that this probably looked a bit strange: Two 24 year old guys, and a 19 year old girl sat in the tiny carriages. Of course, we were the only people actually on the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/betws-y-coed-mini-railway-james-laurence.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-569" width="612" height="600" alt="Me and Laurence on the train!" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Me and &lt;a href="http://andrews.io"&gt;Laurence&lt;/a&gt; on the train!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The train itself was coal fired, and we had to wait for coal to be loaded before we were on our miniature way around the one mile long track. We passed the previously mentioned family about three times, since the track double back and looped on itself as seen in the background of the next photo. It was amusing, to say the least!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/betws-y-coed-mini-railway-museum.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-570" width="816" height="612" alt="betws-y-coed-mini-railway-museum" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we looked around Betws-Y-Coed itself and determined that we couldn't afford anything here we continued along the A5 into Bangor stopping along the way to take some more photographs and to look at hills and waterfalls. It was a great end to a busy weekend trekking around North Wales looking at RNLI stations including Beaumaris, Porthdinllaen, Abersoch, Pwllheli, Criccieth, Llandudno and Conwy (which &lt;a href="http://andrews.io/?page_id=115"&gt;Laurence&lt;/a&gt; will be posting about on his blog 'soon'!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I get hold of them, I'll add some more photos to this post!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2014 17:01:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-04-15:/2014/04/betws-y-coed-miniature-railway-trip/</guid><category>Adventures</category><category>laurence</category><category>train</category><category>uni</category><category>Wales</category></item><item><title>Pelican Blog Workflow and Blogger Migration Tips</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/04/pelican-blog-workflow-and-blogger-migration-tips/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I migrated away from Blogger this month to using &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/"&gt;Pelican Static Site Generator&lt;/a&gt;. It's very different, and the change is quite a bit to get used to. Previously, I'd log into blogger and draft away, add some images and publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I store my raw markdown blog posts in a &lt;a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync"&gt;Bittorrent sync&lt;/a&gt; folder that syncs between my desktop, mobile devices, and netbook. From here, I connect to my webserver using SSH and upload the post and all related media. I then run the pelican command which outputs the static site to the webservers htdocs/www folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros? Absolutely no server side scripting on the server. No PHP, no CGI, and of course there is no MySQL server anywhere in sight. It's brilliant. This also means I sidestep any problems such as the &lt;a href="http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2014/03/wordpress-xml-rpc-pingback-vulnerability-analysis.html"&gt;xmlrpc.php issues&lt;/a&gt; that seem to be plauging Wordpress admins everywhere. Pages also load really damn quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons? It's not as simple! That's pretty much the only draw back I can find! This is not a blogging engine for your mother. Someone has made a tutorial for posting and managing their Pelican install via &lt;a href="http://technivore.org/posts/2014/01/03/blogging-with-dropbox-and-pelican.html"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;. I don't use Dropbox myself, but I imagine it would be easy to adapt to &lt;a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/sync"&gt;Bittorrent Sync&lt;/a&gt; when I'm bored one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being consistant with images is another potential snag. Due to my permalink structure (more on that in a minute!) I store my image media in a top level folder called 'images' therefore I can reference images using '/images/img_name.png' from any post and have them work. If you didn't do it this way, I imagine it'd just be a nightmare keeping track of post media. If you have questions, feel free to leave a comment below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blogger Migration Tip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When moving away from Blogger it's a good idea to keep your permalinks the same as they were to avoid losing out on search engine hits. To achieve this with Pelican, add the following to your pelicanconf.py file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;

    ARTICLE_URL = "{date:%Y}/{date:%m}/{slug}.html"
    ARTICLE_SAVE_AS = "{date:%Y}/{date:%m}/{slug}.html"

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, add the following to make yearly and monthly archive pages work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will result in blog post URLs that match the Blogger's default URLs. Just make sure when you move everything over that you keep the 'slug' the same as what was stored with Blogger otherwise the resulting URLS won't match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for migrating, I did it all manually. I loaded each post up on blogger, used wget to download the images into the [pelican folder]/content/images folder, and then converted each post into Markdown. There is an RSS feed importer but I couldn't find a way to get my older posts importer so I gave up using the importer and spend several weeks moving my posts over to markdown files for Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2014 18:59:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-04-11:/2014/04/pelican-blog-workflow-and-blogger-migration-tips/</guid><category>linux</category><category>blog</category></item><item><title>Two more completed games!</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/04/two-more-completed-games/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was in the mood to play some shorter games (as you may have gathered from my last post) so I started back on playing a few of the Level-5 Guild series games that I had on my console: &lt;a href="http://level5ia.com/blackbox/us/liberation-maiden/"&gt;Liberation Maiden&lt;/a&gt; and Attack of the Friday Monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Liberation Maiden&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Liberation Maiden" src="/images/liberation_maiden.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished Liberation Maiden in just over an hour on easy mode. It was still pretty challenging for me since I don't particularly like arcade shooters, but it was a lot of fun. One day I might go back to the individual stages to try and beat my scores, but not any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Attack of the Friday Monsters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Attack of the Friday Monsters" src="/images/attack_of_the_friday_monsters.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longer than Liberation Maiden, I also rather enjoyed &lt;a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/attack-of-the-friday-monsters!-a-tokyo-tale"&gt;Attack of the Friday Monsters&lt;/a&gt; but I feel that the ending was a bit rushed. The game plays like a visual novel (Think sort of Monkey Island) where you go around talking to various characters, looking for clues, and playing a card game to battle NPCs. The battle system was simple and worked, but probably could of been fleshed out a bit. The story was satsifying (I think, I am still going through it in my mind...) and I'd look forward to a sequel if one were to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the next games!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 10 Apr 2014 18:01:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-04-10:/2014/04/two-more-completed-games/</guid><category>gaming</category><category>3ds</category><category>backlog</category></item><item><title>Completing the backlog: Fun! Fun! Minigolf! Touch!</title><link>https://semaj.omg.lol/2014/04/completing-the-backlog-fun-fun-minigolf-touch/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This week I completed (unlocked everything I could) &lt;a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/fun!-fun!-minigolf-touch!"&gt;Fun! Fun! Minigolf Touch!&lt;/a&gt; for the 3DS. I bought it back in 2012 from the eShop because mini golf is awesome. And then I hardly played it. Maybe it's because games with 'Fun! Fun!' in the title usually aren't actually that fun? Maybe, I thought that this game was alright. Some courses were ridiculously easy, whilst others were randomly very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="/images/2016/11/ctbl-funfunminigolf.jpg" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-491" width="800" height="456" alt="Fun! Fun! Minigolf Touch logo" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption aria-hidden="true"&gt;Fun! Fun! Minigolf Touch logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The normal mode was a blast once I got back into it, trickshot mode on the other hand wasn't brilliant. The requirement to get the ball into a 'safe zone' within one shot did get a bit annoying on the more complicated levels as it required absolute precision in aiming each shot. Additonally, some of the more 'complex' levels were just the same courses with extra boxes and such in the way. There could of been way more imagination used between the European, Asian, and American Cups. I'm thinking hamburgers, great walls, and Eifel Towers if you get what I mean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall my 3DS Activity Log showed that I'd played the game in it's entirety for about three hours. I probably should of gotten around to finishing this years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the next game! Maybe Phoenix Wright Dual Destiny's or another 3DS download title. In fact I've organised a folder on my 3DS which contains the games I want to finish this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario vs Donkey [5:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crimson Shroud [7:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professor Layton: Miracle Mask [16:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picross E [11:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zenonia [17:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phoenix Wright: Dual Destinies [30:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legend of Zelda [10:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legend of Zelda: Links' Awakening [16:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap [16:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weapon Shop de Omasse [9:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monster Hunter 3 [80:00+ Lol. Yeah.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pullblox/Pushmo [15:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jamesleighton.com/2014/04/two-more-completed-games.html"&gt;Attack of the Friday Monsters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [3:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration:line-through;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.jamesleighton.com/2014/04/two-more-completed-games.html"&gt;Liberation Maiden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; [2:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mario Kart Super Circuit [8:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, quite a few are shorter then five hours (however 'how long to beat' timings for puzzle games can be a bit off sometimes...) so I think I'm going to focus on the shorter games for the next few weeks...&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">jamesleighton</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 17:04:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:semaj.omg.lol,2014-04-09:/2014/04/completing-the-backlog-fun-fun-minigolf-touch/</guid><category>games</category><category>3ds</category><category>backlog</category><category>gaming</category></item></channel></rss>
